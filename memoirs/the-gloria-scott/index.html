				<p>"I have some papers here," said my friend Sherlock Holmes, as we sat one
				winter's night on either side of the fire, "which I really think, Watson,
				that it would be worth your while to glance over. These are the documents
				in the extraordinary case of the Gloria Scott, and this is the message
				which struck Justice of the Peace Trevor dead with horror when he read
				it."</p>
				<p>He had picked from a drawer a little tarnished cylinder, and, undoing the
				tape, he handed me a short note scrawled upon a half-sheet of slate-gray
				paper.</p>
				<p>"The supply of game for London is going steadily up," it ran. "Head-keeper
				Hudson, we believe, has been now told to receive all orders for fly-paper
				and for preservation of your hen-pheasant's life."</p>
				<p>As I glanced up from reading this enigmatical message, I saw Holmes
				chuckling at the expression upon my face.</p>
				<p>"You look a little bewildered," said he.</p>
				<p>"I cannot see how such a message as this could inspire horror. It seems to
				me to be rather grotesque than otherwise."</p>
				<p>"Very likely. Yet the fact remains that the reader, who was a fine, robust
				old man, was knocked clean down by it as if it had been the butt end of a
				pistol."</p>
				<p>"You arouse my curiosity," said I. "But why did you say just now that
				there were very particular reasons why I should study this case?"</p>
				<p>"Because it was the first in which I was ever engaged."</p>
				<p>I had often endeavored to elicit from my companion what had first turned
				his mind in the direction of criminal research, but had never caught him
				before in a communicative humor. Now he sat forward in this arm-chair and
				spread out the documents upon his knees. Then he lit his pipe and sat for
				some time smoking and turning them over.</p>
				<p>"You never heard me talk of Victor Trevor?" he asked. "He was the only
				friend I made during the two years I was at college. I was never a very
				sociable fellow, Watson, always rather fond of moping in my rooms and
				working out my own little methods of thought, so that I never mixed much
				with the men of my year. Bar fencing and boxing I had few athletic tastes,
				and then my line of study was quite distinct from that of the other
				fellows, so that we had no points of contact at all. Trevor was the only
				man I knew, and that only through the accident of his bull terrier
				freezing on to my ankle one morning as I went down to chapel.</p>
				<p>"It was a prosaic way of forming a friendship, but it was effective. I was
				laid by the heels for ten days, but Trevor used to come in to inquire
				after me. At first it was only a minute's chat, but soon his visits
				lengthened, and before the end of the term we were close friends. He was a
				hearty, full-blooded fellow, full of spirits and energy, the very opposite
				to me in most respects, but we had some subjects in common, and it was a
				bond of union when I found that he was as friendless as I. Finally, he
				invited me down to his father's place at Donnithorpe, in Norfolk, and I
				accepted his hospitality for a month of the long vacation.</p>
				<p>"Old Trevor was evidently a man of some wealth and consideration, a J.P.,
				and a landed proprietor. Donnithorpe is a little hamlet just to the north
				of Langmere, in the country of the Broads. The house was an old-fashioned,
				wide-spread, oak-beamed brick building, with a fine lime-lined avenue
				leading up to it. There was excellent wild-duck shooting in the fens,
				remarkably good fishing, a small but select library, taken over, as I
				understood, from a former occupant, and a tolerable cook, so that he would
				be a fastidious man who could not put in a pleasant month there.</p>
				<p>"Trevor senior was a widower, and my friend his only son.</p>
				<p>"There had been a daughter, I heard, but she had died of diphtheria while
				on a visit to Birmingham. The father interested me extremely. He was a man
				of little culture, but with a considerable amount of rude strength, both
				physically and mentally. He knew hardly any books, but he had traveled
				far, had seen much of the world. And had remembered all that he had
				learned. In person he was a thick-set, burly man with a shock of grizzled
				hair, a brown, weather-beaten face, and blue eyes which were keen to the
				verge of fierceness. Yet he had a reputation for kindness and charity on
				the country-side, and was noted for the leniency of his sentences from the
				bench.</p>
				<p>"One evening, shortly after my arrival, we were sitting over a glass of
				port after dinner, when young Trevor began to talk about those habits of
				observation and inference which I had already formed into a system,
				although I had not yet appreciated the part which they were to play in my
				life. The old man evidently thought that his son was exaggerating in his
				description of one or two trivial feats which I had performed.</p>
				<p>"'Come, now, Mr. Holmes,' said he, laughing good-humoredly. 'I'm an
				excellent subject, if you can deduce anything from me.'</p>
				<p>"'I fear there is not very much,' I answered; 'I might suggest that you
				have gone about in fear of some personal attack within the last
				twelvemonth.'</p>
				<p>"The laugh faded from his lips, and he stared at me in great surprise.</p>
				<p>"'Well, that's true enough,' said he. 'You know, Victor,' turning to his
				son, 'when we broke up that poaching gang they swore to knife us, and Sir
				Edward Holly has actually been attacked. I've always been on my guard
				since then, though I have no idea how you know it.'</p>
				<p>"'You have a very handsome stick,' I answered. 'By the inscription I
				observed that you had not had it more than a year. But you have taken some
				pains to bore the head of it and pour melted lead into the hole so as to
				make it a formidable weapon. I argued that you would not take such
				precautions unless you had some danger to fear.'</p>
				<p>"'Anything else?' he asked, smiling.</p>
				<p>"'You have boxed a good deal in your youth.'</p>
				<p>"'Right again. How did you know it? Is my nose knocked a little out of the
				straight?'</p>
				<p>"'No,' said I. 'It is your ears. They have the peculiar flattening and
				thickening which marks the boxing man.'</p>
				<p>"'Anything else?'</p>
				<p>"'You have done a good deal of digging by your callosities.'</p>
				<p>"'Made all my money at the gold fields.'</p>
				<p>"'You have been in New Zealand.'</p>
				<p>"'Right again.'</p>
				<p>"'You have visited Japan.'</p>
				<p>"'Quite true.'</p>
				<p>"'And you have been most intimately associated with some one whose
				initials were J. A., and whom you afterwards were eager to entirely
				forget.'</p>
				<p>"Mr. Trevor stood slowly up, fixed his large blue eyes upon me with a
				strange wild stare, and then pitched forward, with his face among the
				nutshells which strewed the cloth, in a dead faint.</p>
				<p>"You can imagine, Watson, how shocked both his son and I were. His attack
				did not last long, however, for when we undid his collar, and sprinkled
				the water from one of the finger-glasses over his face, he gave a gasp or
				two and sat up.</p>
				<p>"'Ah, boys,' said he, forcing a smile, 'I hope I haven't frightened you.
				Strong as I look, there is a weak place in my heart, and it does not take
				much to knock me over. I don't know how you manage this, Mr. Holmes, but
				it seems to me that all the detectives of fact and of fancy would be
				children in your hands. That's your line of life, sir, and you may take
				the word of a man who has seen something of the world.'</p>
				<p>"And that recommendation, with the exaggerated estimate of my ability with
				which he prefaced it, was, if you will believe me, Watson, the very first
				thing which ever made me feel that a profession might be made out of what
				had up to that time been the merest hobby. At the moment, however, I was
				too much concerned at the sudden illness of my host to think of anything
				else.</p>
				<p>"'I hope that I have said nothing to pain you?' said I.</p>
				<p>"'Well, you certainly touched upon rather a tender point. Might I ask how
				you know, and how much you know?' He spoke now in a half-jesting fashion,
				but a look of terror still lurked at the back of his eyes.</p>
				<p>"'It is simplicity itself,' said I. 'When you bared your arm to draw that
				fish into the boat I saw that J. A. had been tattooed in the bend of the
				elbow. The letters were still legible, but it was perfectly clear from
				their blurred appearance, and from the staining of the skin round them,
				that efforts had been made to obliterate them. It was obvious, then, that
				those initials had once been very familiar to you, and that you had
				afterwards wished to forget them.'</p>
				<p>"What an eye you have!" he cried, with a sigh of relief. 'It is just as
				you say. But we won't talk of it. Of all ghosts the ghosts of our old
				lovers are the worst. Come into the billiard-room and have a quiet cigar.'</p>
				<p>"From that day, amid all his cordiality, there was always a touch of
				suspicion in Mr. Trevor's manner towards me. Even his son remarked it.
				'You've given the governor such a turn,' said he, 'that he'll never be
				sure again of what you know and what you don't know.' He did not mean to
				show it, I am sure, but it was so strongly in his mind that it peeped out
				at every action. At last I became so convinced that I was causing him
				uneasiness that I drew my visit to a close. On the very day, however,
				before I left, an incident occurred which proved in the sequel to be of
				importance.</p>
				<p>"We were sitting out upon the lawn on garden chairs, the three of us,
				basking in the sun and admiring the view across the Broads, when a maid
				came out to say that there was a man at the door who wanted to see Mr.
				Trevor.</p>
				<p>"'What is his name?' asked my host.</p>
				<p>"'He would not give any.'</p>
				<p>"'What does he want, then?'</p>
				<p>"'He says that you know him, and that he only wants a moment's
				conversation.'</p>
				<p>"'Show him round here.' An instant afterwards there appeared a little
				wizened fellow with a cringing manner and a shambling style of walking. He
				wore an open jacket, with a splotch of tar on the sleeve, a red-and-black
				check shirt, dungaree trousers, and heavy boots badly worn. His face was
				thin and brown and crafty, with a perpetual smile upon it, which showed an
				irregular line of yellow teeth, and his crinkled hands were half closed in
				a way that is distinctive of sailors. As he came slouching across the lawn
				I heard Mr. Trevor make a sort of hiccoughing noise in his throat, and
				jumping out of his chair, he ran into the house. He was back in a moment,
				and I smelt a strong reek of brandy as he passed me.</p>
				<p>"'Well, my man,' said he. 'What can I do for you?'</p>
				<p>"The sailor stood looking at him with puckered eyes, and with the same
				loose-lipped smile upon his face.</p>
				<p>"'You don't know me?' he asked.</p>
				<p>"'Why, dear me, it is surely Hudson,' said Mr. Trevor in a tone of
				surprise.</p>
				<p>"'Hudson it is, sir,' said the seaman. 'Why, it's thirty year and more
				since I saw you last. Here you are in your house, and me still picking my
				salt meat out of the harness cask.'</p>
				<p>"'Tut, you will find that I have not forgotten old times,' cried Mr.
				Trevor, and, walking towards the sailor, he said something in a low voice.
				'Go into the kitchen,' he continued out loud, 'and you will get food and
				drink. I have no doubt that I shall find you a situation.'</p>
				<p>"'Thank you, sir,' said the seaman, touching his fore-lock. 'I'm just off
				a two-yearer in an eight-knot tramp, short-handed at that, and I wants a
				rest. I thought I'd get it either with Mr. Beddoes or with you.'</p>
				<p>"'Ah!' cried Trevor. 'You know where Mr. Beddoes is?'</p>
				<p>"'Bless you, sir, I know where all my old friends are,' said the fellow
				with a sinister smile, and he slouched off after the maid to the kitchen.
				Mr. Trevor mumbled something to us about having been shipmate with the man
				when he was going back to the diggings, and then, leaving us on the lawn,
				he went indoors. An hour later, when we entered the house, we found him
				stretched dead drunk upon the dining-room sofa. The whole incident left a
				most ugly impression upon my mind, and I was not sorry next day to leave
				Donnithorpe behind me, for I felt that my presence must be a source of
				embarrassment to my friend.</p>
				<p>"All this occurred during the first month of the long vacation. I went up
				to my London rooms, where I spent seven weeks working out a few
				experiments in organic chemistry. One day, however, when the autumn was
				far advanced and the vacation drawing to a close, I received a telegram
				from my friend imploring me to return to Donnithorpe, and saying that he
				was in great need of my advice and assistance. Of course I dropped
				everything and set out for the North once more.</p>
				<p>"He met me with the dog-cart at the station, and I saw at a glance that
				the last two months had been very trying ones for him. He had grown thin
				and careworn, and had lost the loud, cheery manner for which he had been
				remarkable.</p>
				<p>"'The governor is dying,' were the first words he said.</p>
				<p>"'Impossible!' I cried. 'What is the matter?'</p>
				<p>"'Apoplexy. Nervous shock, He's been on the verge all day. I doubt if we
				shall find him alive.'</p>
				<p>"I was, as you may think, Watson, horrified at this unexpected news.</p>
				<p>"'What has caused it?' I asked.</p>
				<p>"'Ah, that is the point. Jump in and we can talk it over while we drive.
				You remember that fellow who came upon the evening before you left us?'</p>
				<p>"'Perfectly.'</p>
				<p>"'Do you know who it was that we let into the house that day?'</p>
				<p>"'I have no idea.'</p>
				<p>"'It was the devil, Holmes,' he cried.</p>
				<p>"I stared at him in astonishment.</p>
				<p>"'Yes, it was the devil himself. We have not had a peaceful hour since&mdash;not
				one. The governor has never held up his head from that evening, and now
				the life has been crushed out of him and his heart broken, all through
				this accursed Hudson.'</p>
				<p>"'What power had he, then?'</p>
				<p>"'Ah, that is what I would give so much to know. The kindly, charitable,
				good old governor&mdash;how could he have fallen into the clutches of such
				a ruffian! But I am so glad that you have come, Holmes. I trust very much
				to your judgment and discretion, and I know that you will advise me for
				the best.'</p>
				<p>"We were dashing along the smooth white country road, with the long
				stretch of the Broads in front of us glimmering in the red light of the
				setting sun. From a grove upon our left I could already see the high
				chimneys and the flag-staff which marked the squire's dwelling.</p>
				<p>"'My father made the fellow gardener,' said my companion, 'and then, as
				that did not satisfy him, he was promoted to be butler. The house seemed
				to be at his mercy, and he wandered about and did what he chose in it. The
				maids complained of his drunken habits and his vile language. The dad
				raised their wages all round to recompense them for the annoyance. The
				fellow would take the boat and my father's best gun and treat himself to
				little shooting trips. And all this with such a sneering, leering,
				insolent face that I would have knocked him down twenty times over if he
				had been a man of my own age. I tell you, Holmes, I have had to keep a
				tight hold upon myself all this time; and now I am asking myself whether,
				if I had let myself go a little more, I might not have been a wiser man.</p>
				<p>"'Well, matters went from bad to worse with us, and this animal Hudson
				became more and more intrusive, until at last, on making some insolent
				reply to my father in my presence one day, I took him by the shoulders and
				turned him out of the room. He slunk away with a livid face and two
				venomous eyes which uttered more threats than his tongue could do. I don't
				know what passed between the poor dad and him after that, but the dad came
				to me next day and asked me whether I would mind apologizing to Hudson. I
				refused, as you can imagine, and asked my father how he could allow such a
				wretch to take such liberties with himself and his household.</p>
				<p>"'"Ah, my boy," said he, "it is all very well to talk, but you don't know
				how I am placed. But you shall know, Victor. I'll see that you shall know,
				come what may. You wouldn't believe harm of your poor old father, would
				you, lad?" He was very much moved, and shut himself up in the study all
				day, where I could see through the window that he was writing busily.</p>
				<p>"'That evening there came what seemed to me to be a grand release, for
				Hudson told us that he was going to leave us. He walked into the
				dining-room as we sat after dinner, and announced his intention in the
				thick voice of a half-drunken man.</p>
				<p>"'"I've had enough of Norfolk," said he. "I'll run down to Mr. Beddoes in
				Hampshire. He'll be as glad to see me as you were, I dare say."</p>
				<p>"'"You're not going away in an unkind spirit, Hudson, I hope," said my
				father, with a tameness which made my blood boil.</p>
				<p>"'"I've not had my 'pology," said he sulkily, glancing in my direction.</p>
				<p>"'"Victor, you will acknowledge that you have used this worthy fellow
				rather roughly," said the dad, turning to me.</p>
				<p>"'"On the contrary, I think that we have both shown extraordinary patience
				towards him," I answered.</p>
				<p>"'"Oh, you do, do you?" he snarls. "Very good, mate. We'll see about
				that!"</p>
				<p>"'He slouched out of the room, and half an hour afterwards left the house,
				leaving my father in a state of pitiable nervousness. Night after night I
				heard him pacing his room, and it was just as he was recovering his
				confidence that the blow did at last fall.'</p>
				<p>"'And how?' I asked eagerly.</p>
				<p>"'In a most extraordinary fashion. A letter arrived for my father
				yesterday evening, bearing the Fordingbridge post-mark. My father read it,
				clapped both his hands to his head, and began running round the room in
				little circles like a man who has been driven out of his senses. When I at
				last drew him down on to the sofa, his mouth and eyelids were all puckered
				on one side, and I saw that he had a stroke. Dr. Fordham came over at
				once. We put him to bed; but the paralysis has spread, he has shown no
				sign of returning consciousness, and I think that we shall hardly find him
				alive.'</p>
				<p>"'You horrify me, Trevor!' I cried. 'What then could have been in this
				letter to cause so dreadful a result?'</p>
				<p>"'Nothing. There lies the inexplicable part of it. The message was absurd
				and trivial. Ah, my God, it is as I feared!'</p>
				<p>"As he spoke we came round the curve of the avenue, and saw in the fading
				light that every blind in the house had been drawn down. As we dashed up
				to the door, my friend's face convulsed with grief, a gentleman in black
				emerged from it.</p>
				<p>"'When did it happen, doctor?' asked Trevor.</p>
				<p>"'Almost immediately after you left.'</p>
				<p>"'Did he recover consciousness?'</p>
				<p>"'For an instant before the end.'</p>
				<p>"'Any message for me.'</p>
				<p>"'Only that the papers were in the back drawer of the Japanese cabinet.'</p>
				<p>"My friend ascended with the doctor to the chamber of death, while I
				remained in the study, turning the whole matter over and over in my head,
				and feeling as sombre as ever I had done in my life. What was the past of
				this Trevor, pugilist, traveler, and gold-digger, and how had he placed
				himself in the power of this acid-faced seaman? Why, too, should he faint
				at an allusion to the half-effaced initials upon his arm, and die of
				fright when he had a letter from Fordingham? Then I remembered that
				Fordingham was in Hampshire, and that this Mr. Beddoes, whom the seaman
				had gone to visit and presumably to blackmail, had also been mentioned as
				living in Hampshire. The letter, then, might either come from Hudson, the
				seaman, saying that he had betrayed the guilty secret which appeared to
				exist, or it might come from Beddoes, warning an old confederate that such
				a betrayal was imminent. So far it seemed clear enough. But then how could
				this letter be trivial and grotesque, as described by the son? He must
				have misread it. If so, it must have been one of those ingenious secret
				codes which mean one thing while they seem to mean another. I must see
				this letter. If there were a hidden meaning in it, I was confident that I
				could pluck it forth. For an hour I sat pondering over it in the gloom,
				until at last a weeping maid brought in a lamp, and close at her heels
				came my friend Trevor, pale but composed, with these very papers which lie
				upon my knee held in his grasp. He sat down opposite to me, drew the lamp
				to the edge of the table, and handed me a short note scribbled, as you
				see, upon a single sheet of gray paper. 'The supply of game for London is
				going steadily up,' it ran. 'Head-keeper Hudson, we believe, has been now
				told to receive all orders for fly-paper and for preservation of your
				hen-pheasant's life.'</p>
				<p>"I dare say my face looked as bewildered as yours did just now when first
				I read this message. Then I reread it very carefully. It was evidently as
				I had thought, and some secret meaning must lie buried in this strange
				combination of words. Or could it be that there was a prearranged
				significance to such phrases as 'fly-paper' and 'hen-pheasant'? Such a
				meaning would be arbitrary and could not be deduced in any way. And yet I
				was loath to believe that this was the case, and the presence of the word
				Hudson seemed to show that the subject of the message was as I had
				guessed, and that it was from Beddoes rather than the sailor. I tried it
				backwards, but the combination 'life pheasant's hen' was not encouraging.
				Then I tried alternate words, but neither 'the of for' nor 'supply game
				London' promised to throw any light upon it.</p>
				<p>"And then in an instant the key of the riddle was in my hands, and I saw
				that every third word, beginning with the first, would give a message
				which might well drive old Trevor to despair.</p>
				<p>"It was short and terse, the warning, as I now read it to my companion:</p>
				<p>"'The game is up. Hudson has told all. Fly for your life.'</p>
				<p>"Victor Trevor sank his face into his shaking hands. 'It must be that, I
				suppose,' said he. "This is worse than death, for it means disgrace as
				well. But what is the meaning of these "head-keepers" and
				"hen-pheasants"?'</p>
				<p>"'It means nothing to the message, but it might mean a good deal to us if
				we had no other means of discovering the sender. You see that he has begun
				by writing "The...game...is," and so on. Afterwards he had, to fulfill the
				prearranged cipher, to fill in any two words in each space. He would
				naturally use the first words which came to his mind, and if there were so
				many which referred to sport among them, you may be tolerably sure that he
				is either an ardent shot or interested in breeding. Do you know anything
				of this Beddoes?'</p>
				<p>"'Why, now that you mention it,' said he, 'I remember that my poor father
				used to have an invitation from him to shoot over his preserves every
				autumn.'</p>
				<p>"'Then it is undoubtedly from him that the note comes,' said I. 'It only
				remains for us to find out what this secret was which the sailor Hudson
				seems to have held over the heads of these two wealthy and respected men.'</p>
				<p>"'Alas, Holmes, I fear that it is one of sin and shame!' cried my friend.
				'But from you I shall have no secrets. Here is the statement which was
				drawn up by my father when he knew that the danger from Hudson had become
				imminent. I found it in the Japanese cabinet, as he told the doctor. Take
				it and read it to me, for I have neither the strength nor the courage to
				do it myself.'</p>
				<p>"These are the very papers, Watson, which he handed to me, and I will read
				them to you, as I read them in the old study that night to him. They are
				endorsed outside, as you see, 'Some particulars of the voyage of the bark
				<em>Gloria Scott</em>, from her leaving Falmouth on the 8th October, 1855,
				to her destruction in N. Lat. 15 degrees 20', W. Long. 25 degrees 14' on
				Nov. 6th.' It is in the form of a letter, and runs in this way:</p>
				<p>"'My dear, dear son, now that approaching disgrace begins to darken the
				closing years of my life, I can write with all truth and honesty that it
				is not the terror of the law, it is not the loss of my position in the
				county, nor is it my fall in the eyes of all who have known me, which cuts
				me to the heart; but it is the thought that you should come to blush for
				me&mdash;you who love me and who have seldom, I hope, had reason to do
				other than respect me. But if the blow falls which is forever hanging over
				me, then I should wish you to read this, that you may know straight from
				me how far I have been to blame. On the other hand, if all should go well
				(which may kind God Almighty grant!), then if by any chance this paper
				should be still undestroyed and should fall into your hands, I conjure
				you, by all you hold sacred, by the memory of your dear mother, and by the
				love which had been between us, to hurl it into the fire and to never give
				one thought to it again.</p>
				<p>"'If then your eye goes on to read this line, I know that I shall already
				have been exposed and dragged from my home, or as is more likely, for you
				know that my heart is weak, by lying with my tongue sealed forever in
				death. In either case the time for suppression is past, and every word
				which I tell you is the naked truth, and this I swear as I hope for mercy.</p>
				<p>"'My name, dear lad, is not Trevor. I was James Armitage in my younger
				days, and you can understand now the shock that it was to me a few weeks
				ago when your college friend addressed me in words which seemed to imply
				that he had surprised my secret. As Armitage it was that I entered a
				London banking-house, and as Armitage I was convicted of breaking my
				country's laws, and was sentenced to transportation. Do not think very
				harshly of me, laddie. It was a debt of honor, so called, which I had to
				pay, and I used money which was not my own to do it, in the certainty that
				I could replace it before there could be any possibility of its being
				missed. But the most dreadful ill-luck pursued me. The money which I had
				reckoned upon never came to hand, and a premature examination of accounts
				exposed my deficit. The case might have been dealt leniently with, but the
				laws were more harshly administered thirty years ago than now, and on my
				twenty-third birthday I found myself chained as a felon with thirty-seven
				other convicts in 'tween-decks of the bark <em>Gloria Scott</em>, bound for
				Australia.</p>
				<p>"'It was the year '55 when the Crimean war was at its height, and the old
				convict ships had been largely used as transports in the Black Sea. The
				government was compelled, therefore, to use smaller and less suitable
				vessels for sending out their prisoners. The Gloria Scott had been in the
				Chinese tea-trade, but she was an old-fashioned, heavy-bowed, broad-beamed
				craft, and the new clippers had cut her out. She was a five-hundred-ton
				boat; and besides her thirty-eight jail-birds, she carried twenty-six of a
				crew, eighteen soldiers, a captain, three mates, a doctor, a chaplain, and
				four warders. Nearly a hundred souls were in her, all told, when we set
				sail from Falmouth.</p>
				<p>"'The partitions between the cells of the convicts, instead of being of
				thick oak, as is usual in convict-ships, were quite thin and frail. The
				man next to me, upon the aft side, was one whom I had particularly noticed
				when we were led down the quay. He was a young man with a clear, hairless
				face, a long, thin nose, and rather nut-cracker jaws. He carried his head
				very jauntily in the air, had a swaggering style of walking, and was,
				above all else, remarkable for his extraordinary height. I don't think any
				of our heads would have come up to his shoulder, and I am sure that he
				could not have measured less than six and a half feet. It was strange
				among so many sad and weary faces to see one which was full of energy and
				resolution. The sight of it was to me like a fire in a snow-storm. I was
				glad, then, to find that he was my neighbor, and gladder still when, in
				the dead of the night, I heard a whisper close to my ear, and found that
				he had managed to cut an opening in the board which separated us.</p>
				<p>"'"Hullo, chummy!" said he, "what's your name, and what are you here for?"</p>
				<p>"'I answered him, and asked in turn who I was talking with.</p>
				<p>"'"I'm Jack Prendergast," said he, "and by God! You'll learn to bless my
				name before you've done with me."</p>
				<p>"'I remembered hearing of his case, for it was one which had made an
				immense sensation throughout the country some time before my own arrest.
				He was a man of good family and of great ability, but of incurably vicious
				habits, who had by an ingenious system of fraud obtained huge sums of
				money from the leading London merchants.</p>
				<p>"'"Ha, ha! You remember my case!" said he proudly.</p>
				<p>"'"Very well, indeed."</p>
				<p>"'"Then maybe you remember something queer about it?"</p>
				<p>"'"What was that, then?"</p>
				<p>"'"I'd had nearly a quarter of a million, hadn't I?"</p>
				<p>"'"So it was said."</p>
				<p>"'"But none was recovered, eh?"</p>
				<p>"'"No."</p>
				<p>"'"Well, where d'ye suppose the balance is?" he asked.</p>
				<p>"'"I have no idea," said I.</p>
				<p>"'"Right between my finger and thumb," he cried. "By God! I've got more
				pounds to my name than you've hairs on your head. And if you've money, my
				son, and know how to handle it and spread it, you can do anything. Now,
				you don't think it likely that a man who could do anything is going to
				wear his breeches out sitting in the stinking hold of a rat-gutted,
				beetle-ridden, mouldy old coffin of a China coaster. No, sir, such a man
				will look after himself and will look after his chums. You may lay to
				that! You hold on to him, and you may kiss the book that he'll haul you
				through."</p>
				<p>"'That was his style of talk, and at first I thought it meant nothing; but
				after a while, when he had tested me and sworn me in with all possible
				solemnity, he let me understand that there really was a plot to gain
				command of the vessel. A dozen of the prisoners had hatched it before they
				came aboard, Prendergast was the leader, and his money was the motive
				power.</p>
				<p>"'"I'd a partner," said he, "a rare good man, as true as a stock to a
				barrel. He's got the dibbs, he has, and where do you think he is at this
				moment? Why, he's the chaplain of this ship&mdash;the chaplain, no less!
				He came aboard with a black coat, and his papers right, and money enough
				in his box to buy the thing right up from keel to main-truck. The crew are
				his, body and soul. He could buy 'em at so much a gross with a cash
				discount, and he did it before ever they signed on. He's got two of the
				warders and Mereer, the second mate, and he'd get the captain himself, if
				he thought him worth it."</p>
				<p>"'"What are we to do, then?" I asked.</p>
				<p>"'"What do you think?" said he. "We'll make the coats of some of these
				soldiers redder than ever the tailor did."</p>
				<p>"'"But they are armed," said I.</p>
				<p>"'"And so shall we be, my boy. There's a brace of pistols for every
				mother's son of us, and if we can't carry this ship, with the crew at our
				back, it's time we were all sent to a young misses' boarding-school. You
				speak to your mate upon the left to-night, and see if he is to be
				trusted."</p>
				<p>"'I did so, and found my other neighbor to be a young fellow in much the
				same position as myself, whose crime had been forgery. His name was Evans,
				but he afterwards changed it, like myself, and he is now a rich and
				prosperous man in the south of England. He was ready enough to join the
				conspiracy, as the only means of saving ourselves, and before we had
				crossed the Bay there were only two of the prisoners who were not in the
				secret. One of these was of weak mind, and we did not dare to trust him,
				and the other was suffering from jaundice, and could not be of any use to
				us.</p>
				<p>"'From the beginning there was really nothing to prevent us from taking
				possession of the ship. The crew were a set of ruffians, specially picked
				for the job. The sham chaplain came into our cells to exhort us, carrying
				a black bag, supposed to be full of tracts, and so often did he come that
				by the third day we had each stowed away at the foot of our beds a file, a
				brace of pistols, a pound of powder, and twenty slugs. Two of the warders
				were agents of Prendergast, and the second mate was his right-hand man.
				The captain, the two mates, two warders, Lieutenant Martin, his eighteen
				soldiers, and the doctor were all that we had against us. Yet, safe as it
				was, we determined to neglect no precaution, and to make our attack
				suddenly by night. It came, however, more quickly than we expected, and in
				this way.</p>
				<p>"'One evening, about the third week after our start, the doctor had come
				down to see one of the prisoners who was ill, and putting his hand down on
				the bottom of his bunk he felt the outline of the pistols. If he had been
				silent he might have blown the whole thing, but he was a nervous little
				chap, so he gave a cry of surprise and turned so pale that the man knew
				what was up in an instant and seized him. He was gagged before he could
				give the alarm, and tied down upon the bed. He had unlocked the door that
				led to the deck, and we were through it in a rush. The two sentries were
				shot down, and so was a corporal who came running to see what was the
				matter. There were two more soldiers at the door of the state-room, and
				their muskets seemed not to be loaded, for they never fired upon us, and
				they were shot while trying to fix their bayonets. Then we rushed on into
				the captain's cabin, but as we pushed open the door there was an explosion
				from within, and there he lay with his brains smeared over the chart of
				the Atlantic which was pinned upon the table, while the chaplain stood
				with a smoking pistol in his hand at his elbow. The two mates had both
				been seized by the crew, and the whole business seemed to be settled.</p>
				<p>"'The state-room was next the cabin, and we flocked in there and flopped
				down on the settees, all speaking together, for we were just mad with the
				feeling that we were free once more. There were lockers all round, and
				Wilson, the sham chaplain, knocked one of them in, and pulled out a dozen
				of brown sherry. We cracked off the necks of the bottles, poured the stuff
				out into tumblers, and were just tossing them off, when in an instant
				without warning there came the roar of muskets in our ears, and the saloon
				was so full of smoke that we could not see across the table. When it
				cleared again the place was a shambles. Wilson and eight others were
				wriggling on the top of each other on the floor, and the blood and the
				brown sherry on that table turn me sick now when I think of it. We were so
				cowed by the sight that I think we should have given the job up if it had
				not been for Prendergast. He bellowed like a bull and rushed for the door
				with all that were left alive at his heels. Out we ran, and there on the
				poop were the lieutenant and ten of his men. The swing skylights above the
				saloon table had been a bit open, and they had fired on us through the
				slit. We got on them before they could load, and they stood to it like
				men; but we had the upper hand of them, and in five minutes it was all
				over. My God! Was there ever a slaughter-house like that ship! Prendergast
				was like a raging devil, and he picked the soldiers up as if they had been
				children and threw them overboard alive or dead. There was one sergeant
				that was horribly wounded and yet kept on swimming for a surprising time,
				until some one in mercy blew out his brains. When the fighting was over
				there was no one left of our enemies except just the warders, the mates,
				and the doctor.</p>
				<p>"'It was over them that the great quarrel arose. There were many of us who
				were glad enough to win back our freedom, and yet who had no wish to have
				murder on our souls. It was one thing to knock the soldiers over with
				their muskets in their hands, and it was another to stand by while men
				were being killed in cold blood. Eight of us, five convicts and three
				sailors, said that we would not see it done. But there was no moving
				Prendergast and those who were with him. Our only chance of safety lay in
				making a clean job of it, said he, and he would not leave a tongue with
				power to wag in a witness-box. It nearly came to our sharing the fate of
				the prisoners, but at last he said that if we wished we might take a boat
				and go. We jumped at the offer, for we were already sick of these
				bloodthirsty doings, and we saw that there would be worse before it was
				done. We were given a suit of sailor togs each, a barrel of water, two
				casks, one of junk and one of biscuits, and a compass. Prendergast threw
				us over a chart, told us that we were shipwrecked mariners whose ship had
				foundered in Lat. 15 degrees and Long 25 degrees west, and then cut the
				painter and let us go.</p>
				<p>"'And now I come to the most surprising part of my story, my dear son. The
				seamen had hauled the fore-yard aback during the rising, but now as we
				left them they brought it square again, and as there was a light wind from
				the north and east the bark began to draw slowly away from us. Our boat
				lay, rising and falling, upon the long, smooth rollers, and Evans and I,
				who were the most educated of the party, were sitting in the sheets
				working out our position and planning what coast we should make for. It
				was a nice question, for the Cape de Verdes were about five hundred miles
				to the north of us, and the African coast about seven hundred to the east.
				On the whole, as the wind was coming round to the north, we thought that
				Sierra Leone might be best, and turned our head in that direction, the
				bark being at that time nearly hull down on our starboard quarter.
				Suddenly as we looked at her we saw a dense black cloud of smoke shoot up
				from her, which hung like a monstrous tree upon the sky line. A few
				seconds later a roar like thunder burst upon our ears, and as the smoke
				thinned away there was no sign left of the <em>Gloria Scott</em>. In an
				instant we swept the boat's head round again and pulled with all our
				strength for the place where the haze still trailing over the water marked
				the scene of this catastrophe.</p>
				<p>"'It was a long hour before we reached it, and at first we feared that we
				had come too late to save any one. A splintered boat and a number of
				crates and fragments of spars rising and falling on the waves showed us
				where the vessel had foundered; but there was no sign of life, and we had
				turned away in despair when we heard a cry for help, and saw at some
				distance a piece of wreckage with a man lying stretched across it. When we
				pulled him aboard the boat he proved to be a young seaman of the name of
				Hudson, who was so burned and exhausted that he could give us no account
				of what had happened until the following morning.</p>
				<p>"'It seemed that after we had left, Prendergast and his gang had proceeded
				to put to death the five remaining prisoners. The two warders had been
				shot and thrown overboard, and so also had the third mate. Prendergast
				then descended into the 'tween-decks and with his own hands cut the throat
				of the unfortunate surgeon. There only remained the first mate, who was a
				bold and active man. When he saw the convict approaching him with the
				bloody knife in his hand he kicked off his bonds, which he had somehow
				contrived to loosen, and rushing down the deck he plunged into the
				after-hold. A dozen convicts, who descended with their pistols in search
				of him, found him with a match-box in his hand seated beside an open
				powder-barrel, which was one of a hundred carried on board, and swearing
				that he would blow all hands up if he were in any way molested. An instant
				later the explosion occurred, though Hudson thought it was caused by the
				misdirected bullet of one of the convicts rather than the mate's match. Be
				the cause what it may, it was the end of the <em>Gloria Scott</em> and of
				the rabble who held command of her.</p>
				<p>"'Such, in a few words, my dear boy, is the history of this terrible
				business in which I was involved. Next day we were picked up by the brig
				<em>Hotspur</em>, bound for Australia, whose captain found no difficulty in
				believing that we were the survivors of a passenger ship which had
				foundered. The transport ship Gloria Scott was set down by the Admiralty
				as being lost at sea, and no word has ever leaked out as to her true fate.
				After an excellent voyage the <em>Hotspur</em> landed us at Sydney, where
				Evans and I changed our names and made our way to the diggings, where,
				among the crowds who were gathered from all nations, we had no difficulty
				in losing our former identities. The rest I need not relate. We prospered,
				we traveled, we came back as rich colonials to England, and we bought
				country estates. For more than twenty years we have led peaceful and
				useful lives, and we hoped that our past was forever buried. Imagine,
				then, my feelings when in the seaman who came to us I recognized instantly
				the man who had been picked off the wreck. He had tracked us down somehow,
				and had set himself to live upon our fears. You will understand now how it
				was that I strove to keep the peace with him, and you will in some measure
				sympathize with me in the fears which fill me, now that he has gone from
				me to his other victim with threats upon his tongue.'</p>
				<p>"Underneath is written in a hand so shaky as to be hardly legible,
				'Beddoes writes in cipher to say H. has told all. Sweet Lord, have mercy
				on our souls!'</p>
				<p>"That was the narrative which I read that night to young Trevor, and I
				think, Watson, that under the circumstances it was a dramatic one. The
				good fellow was heart-broken at it, and went out to the Terai tea
				planting, where I hear that he is doing well. As to the sailor and
				Beddoes, neither of them was ever heard of again after that day on which
				the letter of warning was written. They both disappeared utterly and
				completely. No complaint had been lodged with the police, so that Beddoes
				had mistaken a threat for a deed. Hudson had been seen lurking about, and
				it was believed by the police that he had done away with Beddoes and had
				fled. For myself I believe that the truth was exactly the opposite. I
				think that it is most probable that Beddoes, pushed to desperation and
				believing himself to have been already betrayed, had revenged himself upon
				Hudson, and had fled from the country with as much money as he could lay
				his hands on. Those are the facts of the case, Doctor, and if they are of
				any use to your collection, I am sure that they are very heartily at your
				service."</p>
