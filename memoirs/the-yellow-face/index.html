				<p>[In publishing these short sketches based upon the numerous cases in which
				my companion's singular gifts have made us the listeners to, and
				eventually the actors in, some strange drama, it is only natural that I
				should dwell rather upon his successes than upon his failures. And this
				not so much for the sake of his reputation&mdash;for, indeed, it was when
				he was at his wits' end that his energy and his versatility were most
				admirable&mdash;but because where he failed it happened too often that no
				one else succeeded, and that the tale was left forever without a
				conclusion. Now and again, however, it chanced that even when he erred,
				the truth was still discovered. I have noted of some half-dozen cases of
				the kind; the Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual and that which I am about
				to recount are the two which present the strongest features of interest.]</p>
				<p>Sherlock Holmes was a man who seldom took exercise for exercise's sake.
				Few men were capable of greater muscular effort, and he was undoubtedly
				one of the finest boxers of his weight that I have ever seen; but he
				looked upon aimless bodily exertion as a waste of energy, and he seldom
				bestirred himself save when there was some professional object to be
				served. Then he was absolutely untiring and indefatigable. That he should
				have kept himself in training under such circumstances is remarkable, but
				his diet was usually of the sparest, and his habits were simple to the
				verge of austerity. Save for the occasional use of cocaine, he had no
				vices, and he only turned to the drug as a protest against the monotony of
				existence when cases were scanty and the papers uninteresting.</p>
				<p>One day in early spring he had so far relaxed as to go for a walk with me
				in the Park, where the first faint shoots of green were breaking out upon
				the elms, and the sticky spear-heads of the chestnuts were just beginning
				to burst into their five-fold leaves. For two hours we rambled about
				together, in silence for the most part, as befits two men who know each
				other intimately. It was nearly five before we were back in Baker Street
				once more.</p>
				<p>"Beg pardon, sir," said our page-boy, as he opened the door. "There's been
				a gentleman here asking for you, sir."</p>
				<p>Holmes glanced reproachfully at me. "So much for afternoon walks!" said
				he. "Has this gentleman gone, then?"</p>
				<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
				<p>"Didn't you ask him in?"</p>
				<p>"Yes, sir; he came in."</p>
				<p>"How long did he wait?"</p>
				<p>"Half an hour, sir. He was a very restless gentleman, sir, a-walkin' and
				a-stampin' all the time he was here. I was waitin' outside the door, sir,
				and I could hear him. At last he outs into the passage, and he cries, 'Is
				that man never goin' to come?' Those were his very words, sir. 'You'll
				only need to wait a little longer,' says I. 'Then I'll wait in the open
				air, for I feel half choked,' says he. 'I'll be back before long.' And
				with that he ups and he outs, and all I could say wouldn't hold him back."</p>
				<p>"Well, well, you did your best," said Holmes, as we walked into our room.
				"It's very annoying, though, Watson. I was badly in need of a case, and
				this looks, from the man's impatience, as if it were of importance. Hullo!
				That's not your pipe on the table. He must have left his behind him. A
				nice old brier with a good long stem of what the tobacconists call amber.
				I wonder how many real amber mouthpieces there are in London? Some people
				think that a fly in it is a sign. Well, he must have been disturbed in his
				mind to leave a pipe behind him which he evidently values highly."</p>
				<p>"How do you know that he values it highly?" I asked.</p>
				<p>"Well, I should put the original cost of the pipe at seven and sixpence.
				Now it has, you see, been twice mended, once in the wooden stem and once
				in the amber. Each of these mends, done, as you observe, with silver
				bands, must have cost more than the pipe did originally. The man must
				value the pipe highly when he prefers to patch it up rather than buy a new
				one with the same money."</p>
				<p>"Anything else?" I asked, for Holmes was turning the pipe about in his
				hand, and staring at it in his peculiar pensive way.</p>
				<p>He held it up and tapped on it with his long, thin fore-finger, as a
				professor might who was lecturing on a bone.</p>
				<p>"Pipes are occasionally of extraordinary interest," said he. "Nothing has
				more individuality, save perhaps watches and bootlaces. The indications
				here, however, are neither very marked nor very important. The owner is
				obviously a muscular man, left-handed, with an excellent set of teeth,
				careless in his habits, and with no need to practise economy."</p>
				<p>My friend threw out the information in a very offhand way, but I saw that
				he cocked his eye at me to see if I had followed his reasoning.</p>
				<p>"You think a man must be well-to-do if he smokes a seven-shilling pipe,"
				said I.</p>
				<p>"This is Grosvenor mixture at eightpence an ounce," Holmes answered,
				knocking a little out on his palm. "As he might get an excellent smoke for
				half the price, he has no need to practise economy."</p>
				<p>"And the other points?"</p>
				<p>"He has been in the habit of lighting his pipe at lamps and gas-jets. You
				can see that it is quite charred all down one side. Of course a match
				could not have done that. Why should a man hold a match to the side of his
				pipe? But you cannot light it at a lamp without getting the bowl charred.
				And it is all on the right side of the pipe. From that I gather that he is
				a left-handed man. You hold your own pipe to the lamp, and see how
				naturally you, being right-handed, hold the left side to the flame. You
				might do it once the other way, but not as a constancy. This has always
				been held so. Then he has bitten through his amber. It takes a muscular,
				energetic fellow, and one with a good set of teeth, to do that. But if I
				am not mistaken I hear him upon the stair, so we shall have something more
				interesting than his pipe to study."</p>
				<p>An instant later our door opened, and a tall young man entered the room.
				He was well but quietly dressed in a dark-gray suit, and carried a brown
				wide-awake in his hand. I should have put him at about thirty, though he
				was really some years older.</p>
				<p>"I beg your pardon," said he, with some embarrassment; "I suppose I should
				have knocked. Yes, of course I should have knocked. The fact is that I am
				a little upset, and you must put it all down to that." He passed his hand
				over his forehead like a man who is half dazed, and then fell rather than
				sat down upon a chair.</p>
				<p>"I can see that you have not slept for a night or two," said Holmes, in
				his easy, genial way. "That tries a man's nerves more than work, and more
				even than pleasure. May I ask how I can help you?"</p>
				<p>"I wanted your advice, sir. I don't know what to do and my whole life
				seems to have gone to pieces."</p>
				<p>"You wish to employ me as a consulting detective?"</p>
				<p>"Not that only. I want your opinion as a judicious man&mdash;as a man of
				the world. I want to know what I ought to do next. I hope to God you'll be
				able to tell me."</p>
				<p>He spoke in little, sharp, jerky outbursts, and it seemed to me that to
				speak at all was very painful to him, and that his will all through was
				overriding his inclinations.</p>
				<p>"It's a very delicate thing," said he. "One does not like to speak of
				one's domestic affairs to strangers. It seems dreadful to discuss the
				conduct of one's wife with two men whom I have never seen before. It's
				horrible to have to do it. But I've got to the end of my tether, and I
				must have advice."</p>
				<p>"My dear Mr. Grant Munro&mdash;" began Holmes.</p>
				<p>Our visitor sprang from his chair. "What!" he cried, "you know my name?"</p>
				<p>"If you wish to preserve your incognito," said Holmes, smiling, "I would
				suggest that you cease to write your name upon the lining of your hat, or
				else that you turn the crown towards the person whom you are addressing. I
				was about to say that my friend and I have listened to a good many strange
				secrets in this room, and that we have had the good fortune to bring peace
				to many troubled souls. I trust that we may do as much for you. Might I
				beg you, as time may prove to be of importance, to furnish me with the
				facts of your case without further delay?"</p>
				<p>Our visitor again passed his hand over his forehead, as if he found it
				bitterly hard. From every gesture and expression I could see that he was a
				reserved, self-contained man, with a dash of pride in his nature, more
				likely to hide his wounds than to expose them. Then suddenly, with a
				fierce gesture of his closed hand, like one who throws reserve to the
				winds, he began.</p>
				<p>"The facts are these, Mr. Holmes," said he. "I am a married man, and have
				been so for three years. During that time my wife and I have loved each
				other as fondly and lived as happily as any two that ever were joined. We
				have not had a difference, not one, in thought or word or deed. And now,
				since last Monday, there has suddenly sprung up a barrier between us, and
				I find that there is something in her life and in her thought of which I
				know as little as if she were the woman who brushes by me in the street.
				We are estranged, and I want to know why.</p>
				<p>"Now there is one thing that I want to impress upon you before I go any
				further, Mr. Holmes. Effie loves me. Don't let there be any mistake about
				that. She loves me with her whole heart and soul, and never more than now.
				I know it. I feel it. I don't want to argue about that. A man can tell
				easily enough when a woman loves him. But there's this secret between us,
				and we can never be the same until it is cleared."</p>
				<p>"Kindly let me have the facts, Mr. Munro," said Holmes, with some
				impatience.</p>
				<p>"I'll tell you what I know about Effie's history. She was a widow when I
				met her first, though quite young&mdash;only twenty-five. Her name then
				was Mrs. Hebron. She went out to America when she was young, and lived in
				the town of Atlanta, where she married this Hebron, who was a lawyer with
				a good practice. They had one child, but the yellow fever broke out badly
				in the place, and both husband and child died of it. I have seen his death
				certificate. This sickened her of America, and she came back to live with
				a maiden aunt at Pinner, in Middlesex. I may mention that her husband had
				left her comfortably off, and that she had a capital of about four
				thousand five hundred pounds, which had been so well invested by him that
				it returned an average of seven per cent. She had only been six months at
				Pinner when I met her; we fell in love with each other, and we married a
				few weeks afterwards.</p>
				<p>"I am a hop merchant myself, and as I have an income of seven or eight
				hundred, we found ourselves comfortably off, and took a nice
				eighty-pound-a-year villa at Norbury. Our little place was very
				countrified, considering that it is so close to town. We had an inn and
				two houses a little above us, and a single cottage at the other side of
				the field which faces us, and except those there were no houses until you
				got half way to the station. My business took me into town at certain
				seasons, but in summer I had less to do, and then in our country home my
				wife and I were just as happy as could be wished. I tell you that there
				never was a shadow between us until this accursed affair began.</p>
				<p>"There's one thing I ought to tell you before I go further. When we
				married, my wife made over all her property to me&mdash;rather against my
				will, for I saw how awkward it would be if my business affairs went wrong.
				However, she would have it so, and it was done. Well, about six weeks ago
				she came to me.</p>
				<p>"'Jack,' said she, 'when you took my money you said that if ever I wanted
				any I was to ask you for it.'</p>
				<p>"'Certainly,' said I. 'It's all your own.'</p>
				<p>"'Well,' said she, 'I want a hundred pounds.'</p>
				<p>"I was a bit staggered at this, for I had imagined it was simply a new
				dress or something of the kind that she was after.</p>
				<p>"'What on earth for?' I asked.</p>
				<p>"'Oh,' said she, in her playful way, 'you said that you were only my
				banker, and bankers never ask questions, you know.'</p>
				<p>"'If you really mean it, of course you shall have the money,' said I.</p>
				<p>"'Oh, yes, I really mean it.'</p>
				<p>"'And you won't tell me what you want it for?'</p>
				<p>"'Some day, perhaps, but not just at present, Jack.'</p>
				<p>"So I had to be content with that, though it was the first time that there
				had ever been any secret between us. I gave her a check, and I never
				thought any more of the matter. It may have nothing to do with what came
				afterwards, but I thought it only right to mention it.</p>
				<p>"Well, I told you just now that there is a cottage not far from our house.
				There is just a field between us, but to reach it you have to go along the
				road and then turn down a lane. Just beyond it is a nice little grove of
				Scotch firs, and I used to be very fond of strolling down there, for trees
				are always a neighborly kind of things. The cottage had been standing
				empty this eight months, and it was a pity, for it was a pretty
				two-storied place, with an old-fashioned porch and honeysuckle about it. I
				have stood many a time and thought what a neat little homestead it would
				make.</p>
				<p>"Well, last Monday evening I was taking a stroll down that way, when I met
				an empty van coming up the lane, and saw a pile of carpets and things
				lying about on the grass-plot beside the porch. It was clear that the
				cottage had at last been let. I walked past it, and wondered what sort of
				folk they were who had come to live so near us. And as I looked I suddenly
				became aware that a face was watching me out of one of the upper windows.</p>
				<p>"I don't know what there was about that face, Mr. Holmes, but it seemed to
				send a chill right down my back. I was some little way off, so that I
				could not make out the features, but there was something unnatural and
				inhuman about the face. That was the impression that I had, and I moved
				quickly forwards to get a nearer view of the person who was watching me.
				But as I did so the face suddenly disappeared, so suddenly that it seemed
				to have been plucked away into the darkness of the room. I stood for five
				minutes thinking the business over, and trying to analyze my impressions.
				I could not tell if the face were that of a man or a woman. It had been
				too far from me for that. But its color was what had impressed me most. It
				was of a livid chalky white, and with something set and rigid about it
				which was shockingly unnatural. So disturbed was I that I determined to
				see a little more of the new inmates of the cottage. I approached and
				knocked at the door, which was instantly opened by a tall, gaunt woman
				with a harsh, forbidding face.</p>
				<p>"'What may you be wantin'?' she asked, in a Northern accent.</p>
				<p>"'I am your neighbor over yonder,' said I, nodding towards my house. 'I
				see that you have only just moved in, so I thought that if I could be of
				any help to you in any&mdash;'</p>
				<p>"'Ay, we'll just ask ye when we want ye,' said she, and shut the door in
				my face. Annoyed at the churlish rebuff, I turned my back and walked home.
				All evening, though I tried to think of other things, my mind would still
				turn to the apparition at the window and the rudeness of the woman. I
				determined to say nothing about the former to my wife, for she is a
				nervous, highly strung woman, and I had no wish that she would share the
				unpleasant impression which had been produced upon myself. I remarked to
				her, however, before I fell asleep, that the cottage was now occupied, to
				which she returned no reply.</p>
				<p>"I am usually an extremely sound sleeper. It has been a standing jest in
				the family that nothing could ever wake me during the night. And yet
				somehow on that particular night, whether it may have been the slight
				excitement produced by my little adventure or not I know not, but I slept
				much more lightly than usual. Half in my dreams I was dimly conscious that
				something was going on in the room, and gradually became aware that my
				wife had dressed herself and was slipping on her mantle and her bonnet. My
				lips were parted to murmur out some sleepy words of surprise or
				remonstrance at this untimely preparation, when suddenly my half-opened
				eyes fell upon her face, illuminated by the candle-light, and astonishment
				held me dumb. She wore an expression such as I had never seen before&mdash;such
				as I should have thought her incapable of assuming. She was deadly pale
				and breathing fast, glancing furtively towards the bed as she fastened her
				mantle, to see if she had disturbed me. Then, thinking that I was still
				asleep, she slipped noiselessly from the room, and an instant later I
				heard a sharp creaking which could only come from the hinges of the front
				door. I sat up in bed and rapped my knuckles against the rail to make
				certain that I was truly awake. Then I took my watch from under the
				pillow. It was three in the morning. What on this earth could my wife be
				doing out on the country road at three in the morning?</p>
				<p>"I had sat for about twenty minutes turning the thing over in my mind and
				trying to find some possible explanation. The more I thought, the more
				extraordinary and inexplicable did it appear. I was still puzzling over it
				when I heard the door gently close again, and her footsteps coming up the
				stairs.</p>
				<p>"'Where in the world have you been, Effie?' I asked as she entered.</p>
				<p>"She gave a violent start and a kind of gasping cry when I spoke, and that
				cry and start troubled me more than all the rest, for there was something
				indescribably guilty about them. My wife had always been a woman of a
				frank, open nature, and it gave me a chill to see her slinking into her
				own room, and crying out and wincing when her own husband spoke to her.</p>
				<p>"'You awake, Jack!' she cried, with a nervous laugh. 'Why, I thought that
				nothing could awake you.'</p>
				<p>"'Where have you been?' I asked, more sternly.</p>
				<p>"'I don't wonder that you are surprised,' said she, and I could see that
				her fingers were trembling as she undid the fastenings of her mantle.
				'Why, I never remember having done such a thing in my life before. The
				fact is that I felt as though I were choking, and had a perfect longing
				for a breath of fresh air. I really think that I should have fainted if I
				had not gone out. I stood at the door for a few minutes, and now I am
				quite myself again.'</p>
				<p>"All the time that she was telling me this story she never once looked in
				my direction, and her voice was quite unlike her usual tones. It was
				evident to me that she was saying what was false. I said nothing in reply,
				but turned my face to the wall, sick at heart, with my mind filled with a
				thousand venomous doubts and suspicions. What was it that my wife was
				concealing from me? Where had she been during that strange expedition? I
				felt that I should have no peace until I knew, and yet I shrank from
				asking her again after once she had told me what was false. All the rest
				of the night I tossed and tumbled, framing theory after theory, each more
				unlikely than the last.</p>
				<p>"I should have gone to the City that day, but I was too disturbed in my
				mind to be able to pay attention to business matters. My wife seemed to be
				as upset as myself, and I could see from the little questioning glances
				which she kept shooting at me that she understood that I disbelieved her
				statement, and that she was at her wits' end what to do. We hardly
				exchanged a word during breakfast, and immediately afterwards I went out
				for a walk, that I might think the matter out in the fresh morning air.</p>
				<p>"I went as far as the Crystal Palace, spent an hour in the grounds, and
				was back in Norbury by one o'clock. It happened that my way took me past
				the cottage, and I stopped for an instant to look at the windows, and to
				see if I could catch a glimpse of the strange face which had looked out at
				me on the day before. As I stood there, imagine my surprise, Mr. Holmes,
				when the door suddenly opened and my wife walked out.</p>
				<p>"I was struck dumb with astonishment at the sight of her; but my emotions
				were nothing to those which showed themselves upon her face when our eyes
				met. She seemed for an instant to wish to shrink back inside the house
				again; and then, seeing how useless all concealment must be, she came
				forward, with a very white face and frightened eyes which belied the smile
				upon her lips.</p>
				<p>"'Ah, Jack,' she said, 'I have just been in to see if I can be of any
				assistance to our new neighbors. Why do you look at me like that, Jack?
				You are not angry with me?'</p>
				<p>"'So,' said I, 'this is where you went during the night.'</p>
				<p>"'What do you mean?' she cried.</p>
				<p>"'You came here. I am sure of it. Who are these people, that you should
				visit them at such an hour?'</p>
				<p>"'I have not been here before.'</p>
				<p>"'How can you tell me what you know is false?' I cried. 'Your very voice
				changes as you speak. When have I ever had a secret from you? I shall
				enter that cottage, and I shall probe the matter to the bottom.'</p>
				<p>"'No, no, Jack, for God's sake!' she gasped, in uncontrollable emotion.
				Then, as I approached the door, she seized my sleeve and pulled me back
				with convulsive strength.</p>
				<p>"'I implore you not to do this, Jack,' she cried. 'I swear that I will
				tell you everything some day, but nothing but misery can come of it if you
				enter that cottage.' Then, as I tried to shake her off, she clung to me in
				a frenzy of entreaty.</p>
				<p>"'Trust me, Jack!' she cried. 'Trust me only this once. You will never
				have cause to regret it. You know that I would not have a secret from you
				if it were not for your own sake. Our whole lives are at stake in this. If
				you come home with me, all will be well. If you force your way into that
				cottage, all is over between us.'</p>
				<p>"There was such earnestness, such despair, in her manner that her words
				arrested me, and I stood irresolute before the door.</p>
				<p>"'I will trust you on one condition, and on one condition only,' said I at
				last. 'It is that this mystery comes to an end from now. You are at
				liberty to preserve your secret, but you must promise me that there shall
				be no more nightly visits, no more doings which are kept from my
				knowledge. I am willing to forget those which are passed if you will
				promise that there shall be no more in the future.'</p>
				<p>"'I was sure that you would trust me,' she cried, with a great sigh of
				relief. 'It shall be just as you wish. Come away&mdash;oh, come away up to
				the house.'</p>
				<p>"Still pulling at my sleeve, she led me away from the cottage. As we went
				I glanced back, and there was that yellow livid face watching us out of
				the upper window. What link could there be between that creature and my
				wife? Or how could the coarse, rough woman whom I had seen the day before
				be connected with her? It was a strange puzzle, and yet I knew that my
				mind could never know ease again until I had solved it.</p>
				<p>"For two days after this I stayed at home, and my wife appeared to abide
				loyally by our engagement, for, as far as I know, she never stirred out of
				the house. On the third day, however, I had ample evidence that her solemn
				promise was not enough to hold her back from this secret influence which
				drew her away from her husband and her duty.</p>
				<p>"I had gone into town on that day, but I returned by the 2.40 instead of
				the 3.36, which is my usual train. As I entered the house the maid ran
				into the hall with a startled face.</p>
				<p>"'Where is your mistress?' I asked.</p>
				<p>"'I think that she has gone out for a walk,' she answered.</p>
				<p>"My mind was instantly filled with suspicion. I rushed upstairs to make
				sure that she was not in the house. As I did so I happened to glance out
				of one of the upper windows, and saw the maid with whom I had just been
				speaking running across the field in the direction of the cottage. Then of
				course I saw exactly what it all meant. My wife had gone over there, and
				had asked the servant to call her if I should return. Tingling with anger,
				I rushed down and hurried across, determined to end the matter once and
				forever. I saw my wife and the maid hurrying back along the lane, but I
				did not stop to speak with them. In the cottage lay the secret which was
				casting a shadow over my life. I vowed that, come what might, it should be
				a secret no longer. I did not even knock when I reached it, but turned the
				handle and rushed into the passage.</p>
				<p>"It was all still and quiet upon the ground floor. In the kitchen a kettle
				was singing on the fire, and a large black cat lay coiled up in the
				basket; but there was no sign of the woman whom I had seen before. I ran
				into the other room, but it was equally deserted. Then I rushed up the
				stairs, only to find two other rooms empty and deserted at the top. There
				was no one at all in the whole house. The furniture and pictures were of
				the most common and vulgar description, save in the one chamber at the
				window of which I had seen the strange face. That was comfortable and
				elegant, and all my suspicions rose into a fierce bitter flame when I saw
				that on the mantelpiece stood a copy of a full-length photograph of my
				wife, which had been taken at my request only three months ago.</p>
				<p>"I stayed long enough to make certain that the house was absolutely empty.
				Then I left it, feeling a weight at my heart such as I had never had
				before. My wife came out into the hall as I entered my house; but I was
				too hurt and angry to speak with her, and pushing past her, I made my way
				into my study. She followed me, however, before I could close the door.</p>
				<p>"'I am sorry that I broke my promise, Jack,' said she; 'but if you knew
				all the circumstances I am sure that you would forgive me.'</p>
				<p>"'Tell me everything, then,' said I.</p>
				<p>"'I cannot, Jack, I cannot,' she cried.</p>
				<p>"'Until you tell me who it is that has been living in that cottage, and
				who it is to whom you have given that photograph, there can never be any
				confidence between us,' said I, and breaking away from her, I left the
				house. That was yesterday, Mr. Holmes, and I have not seen her since, nor
				do I know anything more about this strange business. It is the first
				shadow that has come between us, and it has so shaken me that I do not
				know what I should do for the best. Suddenly this morning it occurred to
				me that you were the man to advise me, so I have hurried to you now, and I
				place myself unreservedly in your hands. If there is any point which I
				have not made clear, pray question me about it. But, above all, tell me
				quickly what I am to do, for this misery is more than I can bear."</p>
				<p>Holmes and I had listened with the utmost interest to this extraordinary
				statement, which had been delivered in the jerky, broken fashion of a man
				who is under the influence of extreme emotions. My companion sat silent
				for some time, with his chin upon his hand, lost in thought.</p>
				<p>"Tell me," said he at last, "could you swear that this was a man's face
				which you saw at the window?"</p>
				<p>"Each time that I saw it I was some distance away from it, so that it is
				impossible for me to say."</p>
				<p>"You appear, however, to have been disagreeably impressed by it."</p>
				<p>"It seemed to be of an unnatural color, and to have a strange rigidity
				about the features. When I approached, it vanished with a jerk."</p>
				<p>"How long is it since your wife asked you for a hundred pounds?"</p>
				<p>"Nearly two months."</p>
				<p>"Have you ever seen a photograph of her first husband?"</p>
				<p>"No; there was a great fire at Atlanta very shortly after his death, and
				all her papers were destroyed."</p>
				<p>"And yet she had a certificate of death. You say that you saw it."</p>
				<p>"Yes; she got a duplicate after the fire."</p>
				<p>"Did you ever meet any one who knew her in America?"</p>
				<p>"No."</p>
				<p>"Did she ever talk of revisiting the place?"</p>
				<p>"No."</p>
				<p>"Or get letters from it?"</p>
				<p>"No."</p>
				<p>"Thank you. I should like to think over the matter a little now. If the
				cottage is now permanently deserted we may have some difficulty. If, on
				the other hand, as I fancy is more likely, the inmates were warned of your
				coming, and left before you entered yesterday, then they may be back now,
				and we should clear it all up easily. Let me advise you, then, to return
				to Norbury, and to examine the windows of the cottage again. If you have
				reason to believe that it is inhabited, do not force your way in, but send
				a wire to my friend and me. We shall be with you within an hour of
				receiving it, and we shall then very soon get to the bottom of the
				business."</p>
				<p>"And if it is still empty?"</p>
				<p>"In that case I shall come out to-morrow and talk it over with you.
				Good-by; and, above all, do not fret until you know that you really have a
				cause for it."</p>
				<p>"I am afraid that this is a bad business, Watson," said my companion, as
				he returned after accompanying Mr. Grant Munro to the door. "What do you
				make of it?"</p>
				<p>"It had an ugly sound," I answered.</p>
				<p>"Yes. There's blackmail in it, or I am much mistaken."</p>
				<p>"And who is the blackmailer?"</p>
				<p>"Well, it must be the creature who lives in the only comfortable room in
				the place, and has her photograph above his fireplace. Upon my word,
				Watson, there is something very attractive about that livid face at the
				window, and I would not have missed the case for worlds."</p>
				<p>"You have a theory?"</p>
				<p>"Yes, a provisional one. But I shall be surprised if it does not turn out
				to be correct. This woman's first husband is in that cottage."</p>
				<p>"Why do you think so?"</p>
				<p>"How else can we explain her frenzied anxiety that her second one should
				not enter it? The facts, as I read them, are something like this: This
				woman was married in America. Her husband developed some hateful
				qualities; or shall we say that he contracted some loathsome disease, and
				became a leper or an imbecile? She flies from him at last, returns to
				England, changes her name, and starts her life, as she thinks, afresh. She
				has been married three years, and believes that her position is quite
				secure, having shown her husband the death certificate of some man whose
				name she has assumed, when suddenly her whereabouts is discovered by her
				first husband; or, we may suppose, by some unscrupulous woman who has
				attached herself to the invalid. They write to the wife, and threaten to
				come and expose her. She asks for a hundred pounds, and endeavors to buy
				them off. They come in spite of it, and when the husband mentions casually
				to the wife that there are new-comers in the cottage, she knows in some
				way that they are her pursuers. She waits until her husband is asleep, and
				then she rushes down to endeavor to persuade them to leave her in peace.
				Having no success, she goes again next morning, and her husband meets her,
				as he has told us, as she comes out. She promises him then not to go there
				again, but two days afterwards the hope of getting rid of those dreadful
				neighbors was too strong for her, and she made another attempt, taking
				down with her the photograph which had probably been demanded from her. In
				the midst of this interview the maid rushed in to say that the master had
				come home, on which the wife, knowing that he would come straight down to
				the cottage, hurried the inmates out at the back door, into the grove of
				fir-trees, probably, which was mentioned as standing near. In this way he
				found the place deserted. I shall be very much surprised, however, if it
				is still so when he reconnoitres it this evening. What do you think of my
				theory?"</p>
				<p>"It is all surmise."</p>
				<p>"But at least it covers all the facts. When new facts come to our
				knowledge which cannot be covered by it, it will be time enough to
				reconsider it. We can do nothing more until we have a message from our
				friend at Norbury."</p>
				<p>But we had not a very long time to wait for that. It came just as we had
				finished our tea. "The cottage is still tenanted," it said. "Have seen the
				face again at the window. Will meet the seven o'clock train, and will take
				no steps until you arrive."</p>
				<p>He was waiting on the platform when we stepped out, and we could see in
				the light of the station lamps that he was very pale, and quivering with
				agitation.</p>
				<p>"They are still there, Mr. Holmes," said he, laying his hand hard upon my
				friend's sleeve. "I saw lights in the cottage as I came down. We shall
				settle it now once and for all."</p>
				<p>"What is your plan, then?" asked Holmes, as he walked down the dark
				tree-lined road.</p>
				<p>"I am going to force my way in and see for myself who is in the house. I
				wish you both to be there as witnesses."</p>
				<p>"You are quite determined to do this, in spite of your wife's warning that
				it is better that you should not solve the mystery?"</p>
				<p>"Yes, I am determined."</p>
				<p>"Well, I think that you are in the right. Any truth is better than
				indefinite doubt. We had better go up at once. Of course, legally, we are
				putting ourselves hopelessly in the wrong; but I think that it is worth
				it."</p>
				<p>It was a very dark night, and a thin rain began to fall as we turned from
				the high road into a narrow lane, deeply rutted, with hedges on either
				side. Mr. Grant Munro pushed impatiently forward, however, and we stumbled
				after him as best we could.</p>
				<p>"There are the lights of my house," he murmured, pointing to a glimmer
				among the trees. "And here is the cottage which I am going to enter."</p>
				<p>We turned a corner in the lane as he spoke, and there was the building
				close beside us. A yellow bar falling across the black foreground showed
				that the door was not quite closed, and one window in the upper story was
				brightly illuminated. As we looked, we saw a dark blur moving across the
				blind.</p>
				<p>"There is that creature!" cried Grant Munro. "You can see for yourselves
				that some one is there. Now follow me, and we shall soon know all."</p>
				<p>We approached the door; but suddenly a woman appeared out of the shadow
				and stood in the golden track of the lamp-light. I could not see her face
				in the darkness, but her arms were thrown out in an attitude of entreaty.</p>
				<p>"For God's sake, don't Jack!" she cried. "I had a presentiment that you
				would come this evening. Think better of it, dear! Trust me again, and you
				will never have cause to regret it."</p>
				<p>"I have trusted you too long, Effie," he cried, sternly. "Leave go of me!
				I must pass you. My friends and I are going to settle this matter once and
				forever!" He pushed her to one side, and we followed closely after him. As
				he threw the door open an old woman ran out in front of him and tried to
				bar his passage, but he thrust her back, and an instant afterwards we were
				all upon the stairs. Grant Munro rushed into the lighted room at the top,
				and we entered at his heels.</p>
				<p>It was a cosey, well-furnished apartment, with two candles burning upon
				the table and two upon the mantelpiece. In the corner, stooping over a
				desk, there sat what appeared to be a little girl. Her face was turned
				away as we entered, but we could see that she was dressed in a red frock,
				and that she had long white gloves on. As she whisked round to us, I gave
				a cry of surprise and horror. The face which she turned towards us was of
				the strangest livid tint, and the features were absolutely devoid of any
				expression. An instant later the mystery was explained. Holmes, with a
				laugh, passed his hand behind the child's ear, a mask peeled off from her
				countenance, and there was a little coal black negress, with all her white
				teeth flashing in amusement at our amazed faces. I burst out laughing, out
				of sympathy with her merriment; but Grant Munro stood staring, with his
				hand clutching his throat.</p>
				<p>"My God!" he cried. "What can be the meaning of this?"</p>
				<p>"I will tell you the meaning of it," cried the lady, sweeping into the
				room with a proud, set face. "You have forced me, against my own judgment,
				to tell you, and now we must both make the best of it. My husband died at
				Atlanta. My child survived."</p>
				<p>"Your child?"</p>
				<p>She drew a large silver locket from her bosom. "You have never seen this
				open."</p>
				<p>"I understood that it did not open."</p>
				<p>She touched a spring, and the front hinged back. There was a portrait
				within of a man strikingly handsome and intelligent-looking, but bearing
				unmistakable signs upon his features of his African descent.</p>
				<p>"That is John Hebron, of Atlanta," said the lady, "and a nobler man never
				walked the earth. I cut myself off from my race in order to wed him, but
				never once while he lived did I for an instant regret it. It was our
				misfortune that our only child took after his people rather than mine. It
				is often so in such matches, and little Lucy is darker far than ever her
				father was. But dark or fair, she is my own dear little girlie, and her
				mother's pet." The little creature ran across at the words and nestled up
				against the lady's dress. "When I left her in America," she continued, "it
				was only because her health was weak, and the change might have done her
				harm. She was given to the care of a faithful Scotch woman who had once
				been our servant. Never for an instant did I dream of disowning her as my
				child. But when chance threw you in my way, Jack, and I learned to love
				you, I feared to tell you about my child. God forgive me, I feared that I
				should lose you, and I had not the courage to tell you. I had to choose
				between you, and in my weakness I turned away from my own little girl. For
				three years I have kept her existence a secret from you, but I heard from
				the nurse, and I knew that all was well with her. At last, however, there
				came an overwhelming desire to see the child once more. I struggled
				against it, but in vain. Though I knew the danger, I determined to have
				the child over, if it were but for a few weeks. I sent a hundred pounds to
				the nurse, and I gave her instructions about this cottage, so that she
				might come as a neighbor, without my appearing to be in any way connected
				with her. I pushed my precautions so far as to order her to keep the child
				in the house during the daytime, and to cover up her little face and hands
				so that even those who might see her at the window should not gossip about
				there being a black child in the neighborhood. If I had been less cautious
				I might have been more wise, but I was half crazy with fear that you
				should learn the truth.</p>
				<p>"It was you who told me first that the cottage was occupied. I should have
				waited for the morning, but I could not sleep for excitement, and so at
				last I slipped out, knowing how difficult it is to awake you. But you saw
				me go, and that was the beginning of my troubles. Next day you had my
				secret at your mercy, but you nobly refrained from pursuing your
				advantage. Three days later, however, the nurse and child only just
				escaped from the back door as you rushed in at the front one. And now
				to-night you at last know all, and I ask you what is to become of us, my
				child and me?" She clasped her hands and waited for an answer.</p>
				<p>It was a long ten minutes before Grant Munro broke the silence, and when
				his answer came it was one of which I love to think. He lifted the little
				child, kissed her, and then, still carrying her, he held his other hand
				out to his wife and turned towards the door.</p>
				<p>"We can talk it over more comfortably at home," said he. "I am not a very
				good man, Effie, but I think that I am a better one than you have given me
				credit for being."</p>
				<p>Holmes and I followed them down the lane, and my friend plucked at my
				sleeve as we came out.</p>
				<p>"I think," said he, "that we shall be of more use in London than in
				Norbury."</p>
				<p>Not another word did he say of the case until late that night, when he was
				turning away, with his lighted candle, for his bedroom.</p>
				<p>"Watson," said he, "if it should ever strike you that I am getting a
				little over-confident in my powers, or giving less pains to a case than it
				deserves, kindly whisper 'Norbury' in my ear, and I shall be infinitely
				obliged to you."</p>
