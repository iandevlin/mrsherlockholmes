				<p>The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have
				long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles
				in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have
				eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the
				gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to
				believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to
				the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a
				considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no
				memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of
				this remarkable episode.</p>
				<p>It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I
				was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came
				home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table
				waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather
				had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and
				the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as
				a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence.
				With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had
				surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last,
				saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and
				lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the
				envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend&#8217;s
				noble correspondent could be.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Here is a very fashionable epistle,&#8221; I remarked as he entered.
				&#8220;Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a
				fish-monger and a tide-waiter.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,&#8221; he
				answered, smiling, &#8220;and the humbler are usually the more
				interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social
				summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie.&#8221;</p>
				<p>He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Not social, then?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;No, distinctly professional.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And from a noble client?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;One of the highest in England.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, I congratulate you.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my
				client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his
				case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be
				wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the
				papers diligently of late, have you not?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;It looks like it,&#8221; said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in
				the corner. &#8220;I have had nothing else to do.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I
				read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The
				latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent
				events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his
				wedding?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, with the deepest interest.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord
				St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn
				over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter.
				This is what he says:</p>
				<blockquote>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:&#8212;Lord Backwater tells me that I
				may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I
				have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you
				in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in
				connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is
				acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no
				objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that
				it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o&#8217;clock in
				the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that
				time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of
				paramount importance. Yours faithfully,<br>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;ST. SIMON.&#8217;
				</blockquote>
				<p>&#8220;It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen,
				and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink
				upon the outer side of his right little finger,&#8221; remarked Holmes
				as he folded up the epistle.</p>
				<p>&#8220;He says four o&#8217;clock. It is three now. He will be here in an
				hour.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon
				the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in
				their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client
				is.&#8221; He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of
				reference beside the mantelpiece. &#8220;Here he is,&#8221; said he, sitting
				down and flattening it out upon his knee. &#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Lord Robert Walsingham
				de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.&#8217; Hum! &#8216;Arms:
				Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.&#8217;
				He&#8217;s forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was
				Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The
				Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs.
				They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on
				the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in
				all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something
				more solid.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,&#8221; said I,
				&#8220;for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as
				remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew
				that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the
				intrusion of other matters.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square
				furniture van. That is quite cleared up now&#8212;though, indeed, it
				was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your
				newspaper selections.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal
				column of the <em>Morning Post</em>, and dates, as you see, some weeks
				back: &#8216;A marriage has been arranged,&#8217; it says, &#8216;and will, if
				rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert
				St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty
				Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San
				Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.&#8217; That is all.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Terse and to the point,&#8221; remarked Holmes, stretching his long,
				thin legs towards the fire.</p>
				<p>&#8220;There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society
				papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: &#8216;There will soon be a
				call for protection in the marriage  market, for the present
				free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home
				product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great
				Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across
				the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last
				week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by
				these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself
				for over twenty years proof against the little god&#8217;s arrows, has
				now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty
				Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss
				Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much
				attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child,
				and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to
				considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the
				future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has
				been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years,
				and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small
				estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress
				is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to
				make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a
				British peeress.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Anything else?&#8221; asked Holmes, yawning.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the <em>Morning Post</em>
				to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it
				would be at St. George&#8217;s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen
				intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would
				return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been
				taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later&#8212;that is, on
				Wednesday last&#8212;there is a curt announcement that the wedding had
				taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord
				Backwater&#8217;s place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices
				which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Before the what?&#8221; asked Holmes with a start.</p>
				<p>&#8220;The vanishing of the lady.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;When did she vanish, then?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;At the wedding breakfast.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite
				dramatic, in fact.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during
				the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt
				as this. Pray let me have the details.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I warn you that they are very incomplete.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Perhaps we may make them less so.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a
				morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is
				headed, &#8216;Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding&#8217;:</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the
				greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which
				have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as
				shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the
				previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to
				confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently
				floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush
				the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it
				that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what
				is a common subject for conversation.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;The ceremony, which was performed at St. George&#8217;s, Hanover
				Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the
				father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral,
				Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the
				younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia
				Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of
				Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been
				prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a
				woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to
				force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging
				that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a
				painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler
				and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house
				before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast
				with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and
				retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some
				comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that
				she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an
				ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the
				footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus
				apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress,
				believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his
				daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with
				the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with
				the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which
				will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very
				singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing
				had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There
				are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the
				police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the
				original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some
				other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange
				disappearance of the bride.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And is that all?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is
				a suggestive one.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And it is&#8212;&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance,
				has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a
				<em>danseuse</em> at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom
				for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole
				case is in your hands now&#8212;so far as it has been set forth in the
				public press.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would
				not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell,
				Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I
				have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not
				dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness,
				if only as a check to my own memory.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Lord Robert St. Simon,&#8221; announced our page-boy, throwing open
				the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face,
				high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about
				the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose
				pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His
				manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue
				impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little
				bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off
				his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin
				upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of
				foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat,
				yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters.
				He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to
				right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his
				golden eyeglasses.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Good-day, Lord St. Simon,&#8221; said Holmes, rising and bowing. &#8220;Pray
				take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr.
				Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this
				matter over.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine,
				Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you
				have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir,
				though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of
				society.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;No, I am descending.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I beg pardon.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;My last client of the sort was a king.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;The King of Scandinavia.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;What! Had he lost his wife?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;You can understand,&#8221; said Holmes suavely, &#8220;that I extend to the
				affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to
				you in yours.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Of course! Very right! very right! I&#8217;m sure I beg pardon. As to
				my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may
				assist you in forming an opinion.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public
				prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct&#8212;this
				article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Lord St. Simon glanced over it. &#8220;Yes, it is correct, as far as it
				goes.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could
				offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most
				directly by questioning you.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Pray do so.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;In San Francisco, a year ago.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;You were travelling in the States?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Did you become engaged then?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;But you were on a friendly footing?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was
				amused.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Her father is very rich?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And how did he make his money?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,
				invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady&#8217;s&#8212;your
				wife&#8217;s character?&#8221;</p>
				<p>The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down
				into the fire. &#8220;You see, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;my wife was
				twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she
				ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or
				mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than
				from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy,
				with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of
				traditions. She is impetuous&#8212;volcanic, I was about to say. She
				is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her
				resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the
				name which I have the honour to bear&#8221;&#8212;he gave a little stately
				cough&#8212;&#8220;had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I
				believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that
				anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Have you her photograph?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I brought this with me.&#8221; He opened a locket and showed us the
				full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an
				ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect
				of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the
				exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he
				closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.</p>
				<p>&#8220;The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your
				acquaintance?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I
				met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now
				married her.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a
				<em>fait accompli</em>?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I really have made no inquiries on the subject.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the
				wedding?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Was she in good spirits?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our
				future lives.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the
				wedding?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;She was as bright as possible&#8212;at least until after the
				ceremony.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And did you observe any change in her then?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had
				ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident
				however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible
				bearing upon the case.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Pray let us have it, for all that.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards
				the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it
				fell over into the pew. There was a moment&#8217;s delay, but the
				gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not
				appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of
				the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our
				way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of
				the general public were present, then?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is
				open.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;This gentleman was not one of your wife&#8217;s friends?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a
				common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But
				really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less
				cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do
				on re-entering her father&#8217;s house?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I saw her in conversation with her maid.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And who is her maid?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California
				with her.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;A confidential servant?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed
				her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they
				look upon these things in a different way.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;How long did she speak to this Alice?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;You did not overhear what they said?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Lady St. Simon said something about &#8216;jumping a claim.&#8217; She was
				accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she
				meant.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your
				wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;She walked into the breakfast-room.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;On your arm?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that.
				Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose
				hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She
				never came back.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to
				her room, covered her bride&#8217;s dress with a long ulster, put on a
				bonnet, and went out.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in
				company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who
				had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran&#8217;s house that
				morning.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady,
				and your relations to her.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.
				&#8220;We have been on a friendly footing for some years&#8212;I may say on
				a <em>very</em> friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have
				not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of
				complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes.
				Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and
				devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she
				heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the
				reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I
				feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to
				Mr. Doran&#8217;s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to
				push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my
				wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the
				possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police
				fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again.
				She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a
				row.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Did your wife hear all this?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;No, thank goodness, she did not.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as
				so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid
				some terrible trap for her.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, it is a possible supposition.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;You think so, too?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon
				this as likely?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray
				what is your own theory as to what took place?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I
				have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may
				say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of
				this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a
				social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous
				disturbance in my wife.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back&#8212;I
				will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to
				without success&#8212;I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,&#8221; said
				Holmes, smiling. &#8220;And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have
				nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the
				breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;We could see the other side of the road and the Park.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer.
				I shall communicate with you.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,&#8221; said our
				client, rising.</p>
				<p>&#8220;I have solved it.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Eh? What was that?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I say that I have solved it.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Where, then, is my wife?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Lord St. Simon shook his head. &#8220;I am afraid that it will take
				wiser heads than yours or mine,&#8221; he remarked, and bowing in a
				stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.</p>
				<p>&#8220;It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting
				it on a level with his own,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. &#8220;I
				think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all
				this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the
				case before our client came into the room.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;My dear Holmes!&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I
				remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination
				served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial
				evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a
				trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau&#8217;s example.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;But I have heard all that you have heard.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which
				serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some
				years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich
				the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these
				cases&#8212;but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade!
				You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are
				cigars in the box.&#8221;</p>
				<p>The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat,
				which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a
				black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated
				himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.</p>
				<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up, then?&#8221; asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. &#8220;You
				look dissatisfied.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage
				case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Really! You surprise me.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip
				through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And very wet it seems to have made you,&#8221; said Holmes laying his
				hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;In heaven&#8217;s name, what for?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?&#8221; he
				asked.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Why? What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in
				the one as in the other.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. &#8220;I suppose you
				know all about it,&#8221; he snarled.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in
				the matter?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I think it very unlikely.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found
				this in it?&#8221; He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the
				floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin
				shoes and a bride&#8217;s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked
				in water. &#8220;There,&#8221; said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the
				top of the pile. &#8220;There is a little nut for you to crack, Master
				Holmes.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, indeed!&#8221; said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.
				&#8220;You dragged them from the Serpentine?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper.
				They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me
				that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;By the same brilliant reasoning, every man&#8217;s body is to be found
				in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope
				to arrive at through this?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I am afraid that you will find it difficult.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Are you, indeed, now?&#8221; cried Lestrade with some bitterness. &#8220;I
				am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your
				deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as
				many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And how?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the
				card-case is a note. And here is the very note.&#8221; He slapped it
				down upon the table in front of him. &#8220;Listen to this: &#8216;You will
				see me when all is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.&#8217; Now my theory all
				along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora
				Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was
				responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her
				initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped
				into her hand at the door and which lured her within their
				reach.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Very good, Lestrade,&#8221; said Holmes, laughing. &#8220;You really are
				very fine indeed. Let me see it.&#8221; He took up the paper in a
				listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he
				gave a little cry of satisfaction. &#8220;This is indeed important,&#8221;
				said he.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Ha! you find it so?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. &#8220;Why,&#8221; he
				shrieked, &#8220;you&#8217;re looking at the wrong side!&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;On the contrary, this is the right side.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;The right side? You&#8217;re mad! Here is the note written in pencil
				over here.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel
				bill, which interests me deeply.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing in it. I looked at it before,&#8221; said Lestrade.
				&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Oct. 4th, rooms 8<em>s</em>., breakfast 2<em>s</em>. 6<em>d</em>., cocktail 1<em>s</em>., lunch 2<em>s</em>.
				6<em>d</em>., glass sherry, 8<em>d</em>.&#8217; I see nothing in that.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the
				note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I
				congratulate you again.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve wasted time enough,&#8221; said Lestrade, rising. &#8220;I believe in
				hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.
				Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom
				of the matter first.&#8221; He gathered up the garments, thrust them
				into the bag, and made for the door.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Just one hint to you, Lestrade,&#8221; drawled Holmes before his rival
				vanished; &#8220;I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady
				St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any
				such person.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me,
				tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and
				hurried away.</p>
				<p>He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on
				his overcoat. &#8220;There is something in what the fellow says about
				outdoor work,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;so I think, Watson, that I must
				leave you to your papers for a little.&#8221;</p>
				<p>It was after five o&#8217;clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had
				no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a
				confectioner&#8217;s man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked
				with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and
				presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean
				little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble
				lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold
				woodcock, a pheasant, a <em>pâté de foie gras</em> pie with a group of
				ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries,
				my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian
				Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid
				for and were ordered to this address.</p>
				<p>Just before nine o&#8217;clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the
				room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his
				eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his
				conclusions.</p>
				<p>&#8220;They have laid the supper, then,&#8221; he said, rubbing his hands.</p>
				<p>&#8220;You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I
				am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I
				fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs.&#8221;</p>
				<p>It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,
				dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very
				perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.</p>
				<p>&#8220;My messenger reached you, then?&#8221; asked Holmes.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure.
				Have you good authority for what you say?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;The best possible.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his
				forehead.</p>
				<p>&#8220;What will the Duke say,&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;when he hears that one of
				the family has been subjected to such humiliation?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any
				humiliation.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the
				lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of
				doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she
				had no one to advise her at such a crisis.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;It was a slight, sir, a public slight,&#8221; said Lord St. Simon,
				tapping his fingers upon the table.</p>
				<p>&#8220;You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so
				unprecedented a position.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have
				been shamefully used.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I think that I heard a ring,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;Yes, there are steps
				on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view
				of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here
				who may be more successful.&#8221; He opened the door and ushered in a
				lady and gentleman. &#8220;Lord St. Simon,&#8221; said he &#8220;allow me to
				introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I
				think, you have already met.&#8221;</p>
				<p>At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his
				seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand
				thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended
				dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out
				her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was
				as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was
				one which it was hard to resist.</p>
				<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re angry, Robert,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Well, I guess you have every
				cause to be.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Pray make no apology to me,&#8221; said Lord St. Simon bitterly.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I
				should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of
				rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just
				didn&#8217;t know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn&#8217;t
				fall down and do a faint right there before the altar.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave
				the room while you explain this matter?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;If I may give an opinion,&#8221; remarked the strange gentleman,
				&#8220;we&#8217;ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business
				already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to
				hear the rights of it.&#8221; He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man,
				clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll tell our story right away,&#8221; said the lady. &#8220;Frank here
				and I met in &#8217;84, in McQuire&#8217;s camp, near the Rockies, where Pa
				was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I;
				but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile,
				while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to
				nothing. The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last Pa
				wouldn&#8217;t hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took
				me away to &#8217;Frisco. Frank wouldn&#8217;t throw up his hand, though; so
				he followed me there, and he saw me without Pa knowing anything
				about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just
				fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and
				make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had
				as much as Pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of
				time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived.
				&#8216;Why shouldn&#8217;t we be married right away, then,&#8217; said he, &#8216;and
				then I will feel sure of you; and I won&#8217;t claim to be your
				husband until I come back?&#8217; Well, we talked it over, and he had
				fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting,
				that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek
				his fortune, and I went back to Pa.</p>
				<p>&#8220;The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then
				he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New
				Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a
				miners&#8217; camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was
				my Frank&#8217;s name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was
				very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took
				me to half the doctors in &#8217;Frisco. Not a word of news came for a
				year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really
				dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to &#8217;Frisco, and we came to London,
				and a marriage was arranged, and Pa was very pleased, but I felt
				all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place
				in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I&#8217;d have done
				my duty by him. We can&#8217;t command our love, but we can our
				actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make
				him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may
				imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I
				glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the
				first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked
				again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as
				if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I
				didn&#8217;t drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the
				words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my
				ear. I didn&#8217;t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make
				a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to
				know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to
				tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper,
				and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on
				the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the
				note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a
				line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.
				Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now
				to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.</p>
				<p>&#8220;When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California,
				and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but
				to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to
				have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before
				his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to
				run away and explain afterwards. I hadn&#8217;t been at the table ten
				minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of
				the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park.
				I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman
				came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to
				me&#8212;seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little
				secret of his own before marriage also&#8212;but I managed to get away
				from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and
				away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and
				that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank
				had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to
				&#8217;Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to
				England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the
				very morning of my second wedding.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I saw it in a paper,&#8221; explained the American. &#8220;It gave the name
				and the church but not where the lady lived.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all
				for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I
				should like to vanish away and never see any of them again&#8212;just
				sending a line to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It
				was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting
				round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So
				Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of
				them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away
				somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we
				should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good
				gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how
				he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very
				clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and
				that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so
				secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord
				St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at
				once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if
				I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very
				meanly of me.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but
				had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this
				long narrative.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it is not my custom to discuss my most
				intimate personal affairs in this public manner.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Then you won&#8217;t forgive me? You won&#8217;t shake hands before I go?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.&#8221; He put out
				his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.</p>
				<p>&#8220;I had hoped,&#8221; suggested Holmes, &#8220;that you would have joined us
				in a friendly supper.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I think that there you ask a little too much,&#8221; responded his
				Lordship. &#8220;I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent
				developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over
				them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a
				very good-night.&#8221; He included us all in a sweeping bow and
				stalked out of the room.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your
				company,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes. &#8220;It is always a joy to meet an
				American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the
				folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone
				years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens
				of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a
				quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes.&#8221;
				<br><br><p>
				&#8220;The case has been an interesting one,&#8221; remarked Holmes when our
				visitors had left us, &#8220;because it serves to show very clearly how
				simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight
				seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural
				than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing
				stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr.
				Lestrade of Scotland Yard.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;You were not yourself at fault at all, then?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that
				the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony,
				the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of
				returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the
				morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that
				something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was
				out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she
				seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America
				because she had spent so short a time in this country that she
				could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence
				over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change
				her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a
				process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an
				American. Then who could this American be, and why should he
				possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might
				be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in
				rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got
				before I ever heard Lord St. Simon&#8217;s narrative. When he told us
				of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride&#8217;s manner, of so
				transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a
				bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very
				significant allusion to claim-jumping&#8212;which in miners&#8217; parlance
				means taking possession of that which another person has a prior
				claim to&#8212;the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had
				gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a
				previous husband&#8212;the chances being in favour of the latter.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And how in the world did you find them?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held
				information in his hands the value of which he did not himself
				know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance,
				but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had
				settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;How did you deduce the select?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence
				for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive
				hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate.
				In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I
				learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an
				American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking
				over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I
				had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded
				to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate
				enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them
				some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be
				better in every way that they should make their position a little
				clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in
				particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I
				made him keep the appointment.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;But with no very good result,&#8221; I remarked. &#8220;His conduct was
				certainly not very gracious.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Ah, Watson,&#8221; said Holmes, smiling, &#8220;perhaps you would not be
				very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and
				wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of
				fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully
				and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in
				the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for
				the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away
				these bleak autumnal evenings.&#8221;</p>
