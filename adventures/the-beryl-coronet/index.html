				<p>Holmes,&#8221; said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking
				down the street, &#8220;here is a madman coming along. It seems rather
				sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone.&#8221;</p></p>
				<p>My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands
				in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It
				was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day
				before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the
				wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed
				into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and
				on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as
				when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but
				was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer
				passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the
				Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman
				whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.</p></p>
				<p>He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a
				massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was
				dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining
				hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet
				his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress
				and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little
				springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to
				set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and
				down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most
				extraordinary contortions.</p>
				<p>&#8220;What on earth can be the matter with him?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;He is
				looking up at the numbers of the houses.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I believe that he is coming here,&#8221; said Holmes, rubbing his
				hands.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Here?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I
				think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?&#8221; As
				he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and
				pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the
				clanging.</p>
				<p>A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still
				gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in
				his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and
				pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his
				body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the
				extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his
				feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we
				both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room.
				Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting
				beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy,
				soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.</p>
				<p>&#8220;You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?&#8221; said he.
				&#8220;You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have
				recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into
				any little problem which you may submit to me.&#8221;</p>
				<p>The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting
				against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his
				brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.</p>
				<p>&#8220;No doubt you think me mad?&#8221; said he.</p>
				<p>&#8220;I see that you have had some great trouble,&#8221; responded Holmes.</p>
				<p>&#8220;God knows I have!&#8212;a trouble which is enough to unseat my
				reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might
				have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet
				borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man;
				but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have
				been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone.
				The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found
				out of this horrible affair.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Pray compose yourself, sir,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;and let me have a
				clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen
				you.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;My name,&#8221; answered our visitor, &#8220;is probably familiar to your
				ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &amp;
				Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street.&#8221;</p>
				<p>The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior
				partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City
				of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the
				foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We
				waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced
				himself to tell his story.</p>
				<p>&#8220;I feel that time is of value,&#8221; said he; &#8220;that is why I hastened
				here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure
				your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and
				hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this
				snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who
				takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the
				facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.</p>
				<p>&#8220;It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking
				business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative
				investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection
				and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means
				of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security
				is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction
				during the last few years, and there are many noble families to
				whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their
				pictures, libraries, or plate.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a
				card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I
				saw the name, for it was that of none other than&#8212;well, perhaps
				even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name
				which is a household word all over the earth&#8212;one of the highest,
				noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the
				honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged
				at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry
				quickly through a disagreeable task.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Mr. Holder,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I have been informed that you are in the
				habit of advancing money.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;The firm does so when the security is good.&#8217; I answered.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;It is absolutely essential to me,&#8217; said he, &#8216;that I should have
				<em>£</em>50,000 at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a
				sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it
				a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my
				position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place
				one&#8217;s self under obligations.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?&#8217; I asked.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most
				certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you
				think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the
				money should be paid at once.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my
				own private purse,&#8217; said I, &#8216;were it not that the strain would be
				rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do
				it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must
				insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution
				should be taken.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;I should much prefer to have it so,&#8217; said he, raising up a
				square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair.
				&#8216;You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,&#8217;
				said I.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Precisely.&#8217; He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,
				flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery
				which he had named. &#8216;There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,&#8217; said
				he, &#8216;and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The
				lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the
				sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my
				security.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some
				perplexity from it to my illustrious client.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;You doubt its value?&#8217; he asked.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Not at all. I only doubt&#8212;&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest
				about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely
				certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a
				pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Ample.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof
				of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I
				have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to
				refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to
				preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I
				need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any
				harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as
				serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the
				world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them.
				I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall
				call for it in person on Monday morning.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,
				calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty <em>£</em>1000
				notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the
				precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not
				but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility
				which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it
				was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any
				misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever
				consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter
				the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned
				once more to my work.</p>
				<p>&#8220;When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave
				so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers&#8217; safes had
				been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how
				terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I
				determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always
				carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might
				never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a
				cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel
				with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs
				and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.</p>
				<p>&#8220;And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to
				thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep
				out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three
				maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose
				absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy
				Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few
				months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has
				always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has
				attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place.
				That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we
				believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.</p>
				<p>&#8220;So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it
				will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an
				only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr.
				Holmes&#8212;a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am
				myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very
				likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I
				had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a
				moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it
				would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I
				meant it for the best.</p>
				<p>&#8220;It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my
				business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild,
				wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the
				handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a
				member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming
				manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long
				purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards
				and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again
				to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his
				allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried
				more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he
				was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir
				George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.</p>
				<p>&#8220;And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George
				Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently
				brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could
				hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than
				Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been
				everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of
				great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far
				away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his
				cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that
				he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so,
				too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman&#8217;s quick insight into
				character.</p>
				<p>&#8220;And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but
				when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the
				world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my
				daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house&#8212;sweet, loving, beautiful,
				a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and
				gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know
				what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone
				against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for
				he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I
				think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it
				would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his
				whole life; but now, alas! it is too late&#8212;forever too late!</p>
				<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and
				I shall continue with my miserable story.</p>
				<p>&#8220;When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after
				dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious
				treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name
				of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am
				sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.
				Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous
				coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Where have you put it?&#8217; asked Arthur.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;In my own bureau.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Well, I hope to goodness the house won&#8217;t be burgled during the
				night.&#8217; said he.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;It is locked up,&#8217; I answered.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I
				have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of
				what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with
				a very grave face.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Look here, dad,&#8217; said he with his eyes cast down, &#8216;can you let
				me have <em>£</em>200?&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;No, I cannot!&#8217; I answered sharply. &#8216;I have been far too
				generous with you in money matters.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;You have been very kind,&#8217; said he, &#8216;but I must have this money,
				or else I can never show my face inside the club again.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;And a very good thing, too!&#8217; I cried.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,&#8217;
				said he. &#8216;I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money
				in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try
				other means.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the
				month. &#8216;You shall not have a farthing from me,&#8217; I cried, on which
				he bowed and left the room without another word.</p>
				<p>&#8220;When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my
				treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go
				round the house to see that all was secure&#8212;a duty which I
				usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform
				myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself
				at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as
				I approached.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Tell me, dad,&#8217; said she, looking, I thought, a little
				disturbed, &#8216;did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out
				to-night?&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Certainly not.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she
				has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that
				it is hardly safe and should be stopped.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer
				it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Quite sure, dad.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Then, good-night.&#8217; I kissed her and went up to my bedroom
				again, where I was soon asleep.</p>
				<p>&#8220;I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may
				have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question
				me upon any point which I do not make clear.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be
				particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety
				in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual.
				About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in
				the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an
				impression behind it as though a window had gently closed
				somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my
				horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in
				the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear,
				and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Arthur!&#8217; I screamed, &#8216;you villain! you thief! How dare you
				touch that coronet?&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy,
				dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the
				light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be
				wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry
				he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I
				snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with
				three of the beryls in it, was missing.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;You blackguard!&#8217; I shouted, beside myself with rage. &#8216;You have
				destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the
				jewels which you have stolen?&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Stolen!&#8217; he cried.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Yes, thief!&#8217; I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,&#8217; said he.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I
				call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to
				tear off another piece?&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;You have called me names enough,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I will not stand it
				any longer. I shall not say another word about this business,
				since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in
				the morning and make my own way in the world.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;You shall leave it in the hands of the police!&#8217; I cried
				half-mad with grief and rage. &#8216;I shall have this matter probed to
				the bottom.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;You shall learn nothing from me,&#8217; said he with a passion such
				as I should not have thought was in his nature. &#8216;If you choose to
				call the police, let the police find what they can.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my
				voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and,
				at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur&#8217;s face, she read the
				whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the
				ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the
				investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a
				constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with
				his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge
				him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private
				matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was
				national property. I was determined that the law should have its
				way in everything.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;At least,&#8217; said he, &#8216;you will not have me arrested at once. It
				would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the
				house for five minutes.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you
				have stolen,&#8217; said I. And then, realising the dreadful position
				in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only
				my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at
				stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would
				convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell
				me what he had done with the three missing stones.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;You may as well face the matter,&#8217; said I; &#8216;you have been caught
				in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous.
				If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling
				us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,&#8217; he answered,
				turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened
				for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for
				it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search
				was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of
				every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed
				the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the
				wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our
				threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after
				going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to
				you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter.
				The police have openly confessed that they can at present make
				nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think
				necessary. I have already offered a reward of <em>£</em>1000. My
				God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son
				in one night. Oh, what shall I do!&#8221;</p>
				<p>He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to
				and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got
				beyond words.</p>
				<p>Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows
				knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Do you receive much company?&#8221; he asked.</p>
				<p>&#8220;None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of
				Arthur&#8217;s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No
				one else, I think.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Do you go out much in society?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for
				it.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;That is unusual in a young girl.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She
				is four-and-twenty.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to
				her also.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Terrible! She is even more affected than I.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;You have neither of you any doubt as to your son&#8217;s guilt?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet
				in his hands.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of
				the coronet at all injured?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes, it was twisted.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to
				straighten it?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me.
				But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If
				his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie?
				His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several
				singular points about the case. What did the police think of the
				noise which awoke you from your sleep?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;They considered that it might be caused by Arthur&#8217;s closing his
				bedroom door.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door
				so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the
				disappearance of these gems?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture
				in the hope of finding them.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Have they thought of looking outside the house?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has
				already been minutely examined.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Now, my dear sir,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;is it not obvious to you now
				that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you
				or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you
				to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider
				what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came
				down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room,
				opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main
				force a small portion of it, went off to some other place,
				concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that
				nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six
				into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger
				of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;But what other is there?&#8221; cried the banker with a gesture of
				despair. &#8220;If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain
				them?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;It is our task to find that out,&#8221; replied Holmes; &#8220;so now, if
				you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together,
				and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into
				details.&#8221;</p>
				<p>My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition,
				which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy
				were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I
				confess that the guilt of the banker&#8217;s son appeared to me to be
				as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such
				faith in Holmes&#8217; judgment that I felt that there must be some
				grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted
				explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the
				southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his
				hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client
				appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope
				which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a
				desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway
				journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest
				residence of the great financier.</p>
				<p>Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing
				back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a
				snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates
				which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden
				thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges
				stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the
				tradesmen&#8217;s entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the
				stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a
				public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing
				at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the
				front, down the tradesmen&#8217;s path, and so round by the garden
				behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I
				went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should
				return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and
				a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height,
				slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against
				the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever
				seen such deadly paleness in a woman&#8217;s face. Her lips, too, were
				bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept
				silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of
				grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the
				more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong
				character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding
				my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand
				over his head with a sweet womanly caress.</p>
				<p>&#8220;You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you
				not, dad?&#8221; she asked.</p>
				<p>&#8220;No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman&#8217;s
				instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will
				be sorry for having acted so harshly.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should
				suspect him.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with
				the coronet in his hand?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take
				my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say
				no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in
				prison!&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I shall never let it drop until the gems are found&#8212;never, Mary!
				Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences
				to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman
				down from London to inquire more deeply into it.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;This gentleman?&#8221; she asked, facing round to me.</p>
				<p>&#8220;No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in
				the stable lane now.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;The stable lane?&#8221; She raised her dark eyebrows. &#8220;What can he
				hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir,
				that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth,
				that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may
				prove it,&#8221; returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the
				snow from his shoes. &#8220;I believe I have the honour of addressing
				Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;You heard nothing yourself last night?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard
				that, and I came down.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you
				fasten all the windows?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Were they all fastened this morning?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked
				to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and
				who may have heard uncle&#8217;s remarks about the coronet.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her
				sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;But what is the good of all these vague theories,&#8221; cried the
				banker impatiently, &#8220;when I have told you that I saw Arthur with
				the coronet in his hands?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this
				girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I
				presume?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I
				met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Do you know him?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round.
				His name is Francis Prosper.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;He stood,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;to the left of the door&#8212;that is to
				say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes, he did.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And he is a man with a wooden leg?&#8221;</p>
				<p>Something like fear sprang up in the young lady&#8217;s expressive
				black eyes. &#8220;Why, you are like a magician,&#8221; said she. &#8220;How do you
				know that?&#8221; She smiled, but there was no answering smile in
				Holmes&#8217; thin, eager face.</p>
				<p>&#8220;I should be very glad now to go upstairs,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I shall
				probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps
				I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up.&#8221;</p>
				<p>He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at
				the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.
				This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill
				with his powerful magnifying lens. &#8220;Now we shall go upstairs,&#8221;
				said he at last.</p>
				<p>The banker&#8217;s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little
				chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror.
				Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Which key was used to open it?&#8221; he asked.</p>
				<p>&#8220;That which my son himself indicated&#8212;that of the cupboard of the
				lumber-room.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Have you it here?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;That is it on the dressing-table.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.</p>
				<p>&#8220;It is a noiseless lock,&#8221; said he. &#8220;It is no wonder that it did
				not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must
				have a look at it.&#8221; He opened the case, and taking out the diadem
				he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the
				jeweller&#8217;s art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I
				have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge,
				where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Holder,&#8221; said Holmes, &#8220;here is the corner which
				corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I
				beg that you will break it off.&#8221;</p>
				<p>The banker recoiled in horror. &#8220;I should not dream of trying,&#8221;
				said he.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Then I will.&#8221; Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but
				without result. &#8220;I feel it give a little,&#8221; said he; &#8220;but, though
				I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my
				time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do
				you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would
				be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this
				happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard
				nothing of it?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think,
				Miss Holder?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I confess that I still share my uncle&#8217;s perplexity.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary
				luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault
				if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your
				permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations
				outside.&#8221;</p>
				<p>He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any
				unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an
				hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet
				heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.</p>
				<p>&#8220;I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr.
				Holder,&#8221; said he; &#8220;I can serve you best by returning to my
				rooms.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I cannot tell.&#8221;</p>
				<p>The banker wrung his hands. &#8220;I shall never see them again!&#8221; he
				cried. &#8220;And my son? You give me hopes?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;My opinion is in no way altered.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Then, for God&#8217;s sake, what was this dark business which was
				acted in my house last night?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow
				morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to
				make it clearer. I understand that you give me <em>carte blanche</em> to
				act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you
				place no limit on the sum I may draw.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I would give my fortune to have them back.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.
				Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here
				again before evening.&#8221;</p>
				<p>It was obvious to me that my companion&#8217;s mind was now made up
				about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than
				I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward
				journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always
				glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in
				despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our
				rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in
				a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned
				up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he
				was a perfect sample of the class.</p>
				<p>&#8220;I think that this should do,&#8221; said he, glancing into the glass
				above the fireplace. &#8220;I only wish that you could come with me,
				Watson, but I fear that it won&#8217;t do. I may be on the trail in
				this matter, or I may be following a will-o&#8217;-the-wisp, but I
				shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few
				hours.&#8221; He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard,
				sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this
				rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.</p>
				<p>I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in
				excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his
				hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a
				cup of tea.</p>
				<p>&#8220;I only looked in as I passed,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I am going right on.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time
				before I get back. Don&#8217;t wait up for me in case I should be
				late.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;How are you getting on?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham
				since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a
				very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a
				good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get
				these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly
				respectable self.&#8221;</p>
				<p>I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for
				satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled,
				and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He
				hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of
				the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his
				congenial hunt.</p>
				<p>I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so
				I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away
				for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that
				his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he
				came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there
				he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the
				other, as fresh and trim as possible.</p>
				<p>&#8220;You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but
				you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this
				morning.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Why, it is after nine now,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;I should not be
				surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring.&#8221;</p>
				<p>It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the
				change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally
				of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in,
				while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered
				with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than
				his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into
				the armchair which I pushed forward for him.</p>
				<p>&#8220;I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,&#8221; said
				he. &#8220;Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without
				a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured
				age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece,
				Mary, has deserted me.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Deserted you?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was
				empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to
				her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had
				married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was
				thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers
				in this note:</p>
				<blockquote>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;MY DEAREST UNCLE:&#8212;I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,
				and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune
				might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my
				mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must
				leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is
				provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will
				be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in
				death, I am ever your loving<br>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;MARY.&#8217;</blockquote>
				<p>&#8220;What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it
				points to suicide?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible
				solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of
				your troubles.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have
				learned something! Where are the gems?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;You would not think <em>£</em>1000 apiece an excessive sum for
				them?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I would pay ten.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter.
				And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book?
				Here is a pen. Better make it out for <em>£</em>4000.&#8221;</p>
				<p>With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes
				walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of
				gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.</p>
				<p>With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.</p>
				<p>&#8220;You have it!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;I am saved! I am saved!&#8221;</p>
				<p>The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and
				he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.</p>
				<p>&#8220;There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,&#8221; said Sherlock
				Holmes rather sternly.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Owe!&#8221; He caught up a pen. &#8220;Name the sum, and I will pay it.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that
				noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I
				should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to
				have one.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Then it was not Arthur who took them?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him
				know that the truth is known.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an
				interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the
				story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was
				right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite
				clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his
				lips.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary
				mystery!&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached
				it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me
				to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding
				between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now
				fled together.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;My Mary? Impossible!&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither
				you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you
				admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most
				dangerous men in England&#8212;a ruined gambler, an absolutely
				desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece
				knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he
				had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she
				alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said,
				but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing
				him nearly every evening.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I cannot, and I will not, believe it!&#8221; cried the banker with an
				ashen face.</p>
				<p>&#8220;I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night.
				Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room,
				slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which
				leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right
				through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the
				coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he
				bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but
				there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all
				other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had
				hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming
				downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you
				about one of the servants&#8217; escapade with her wooden-legged lover,
				which was all perfectly true.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but
				he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.
				In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door,
				so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin
				walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared
				into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad
				slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what
				would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the
				room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw
				that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed
				down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and
				slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see
				what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the
				window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then
				closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close
				to where he stood hid behind the curtain.</p>
				<p>&#8220;As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action
				without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the
				instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune
				this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it
				right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened
				the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane,
				where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George
				Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was
				a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the
				coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son
				struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something
				suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet
				in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your
				room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in
				the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you
				appeared upon the scene.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Is it possible?&#8221; gasped the banker.</p>
				<p>&#8220;You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when
				he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not
				explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who
				certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He
				took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her
				secret.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the
				coronet,&#8221; cried Mr. Holder. &#8220;Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have
				been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes!
				The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the
				scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;When I arrived at the house,&#8221; continued Holmes, &#8220;I at once went
				very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in
				the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since
				the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost
				to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen&#8217;s path, but
				found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it,
				however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood
				and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed
				that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been
				disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was
				shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had
				waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time
				that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had
				already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed
				round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks,
				which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable
				lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in
				front of me.</p>
				<p>&#8220;There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second
				double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked
				feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the
				latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the
				other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over
				the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed
				after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the
				hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while
				waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred
				yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round,
				where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle,
				and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me
				that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and
				another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been
				hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that
				the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.</p>
				<p>&#8220;On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the
				sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could
				at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the
				outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming
				in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what
				had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had
				brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had
				pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged
				at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which
				neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the
				prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So
				far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who
				was it brought him the coronet?</p>
				<p>&#8220;It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the
				impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the
				truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down,
				so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were
				the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in
				their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his
				cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should
				retain her secret&#8212;the more so as the secret was a disgraceful
				one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and
				how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture
				became a certainty.</p>
				<p>&#8220;And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently,
				for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must
				feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your
				circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir
				George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil
				reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots
				and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur
				had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was
				safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his
				own family.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took
				next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George&#8217;s house,
				managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that
				his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at
				the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of
				his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and
				saw that they exactly fitted the tracks.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,&#8221;
				said Mr. Holder.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home
				and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to
				play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert
				scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our
				hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of
				course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every
				particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a
				life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I
				clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he
				became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give
				him a price for the stones he held&#8212;<em>£</em>1000 apiece. That
				brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. &#8216;Why,
				dash it all!&#8217; said he, &#8216;I&#8217;ve let them go at six hundred for the
				three!&#8217; I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had
				them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I
				set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at <em>£</em>1000
				apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all
				was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o&#8217;clock, after
				what I may call a really hard day&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,&#8221; said
				the banker, rising. &#8220;Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but
				you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your
				skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I
				must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I
				have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my
				very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I think that we may safely say,&#8221; returned Holmes, &#8220;that she is
				wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that
				whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than
				sufficient punishment.&#8221;</p>
