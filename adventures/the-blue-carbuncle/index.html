			<article>
				<p>I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second
				morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the
				compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a
				purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the
				right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly
				studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and
				on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable
				hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several
				places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair
				suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the
				purpose of examination.</p>
				<p>&#8220;You are engaged,&#8221; said I; &#8220;perhaps I interrupt you.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss
				my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one&#8221;&#8212;he jerked his
				thumb in the direction of the old hat&#8212;&#8220;but there are points in
				connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and
				even of instruction.&#8221;</p>
				<p>I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his
				crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows
				were thick with the ice crystals. &#8220;I suppose,&#8221; I remarked, &#8220;that,
				homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to
				it&#8212;that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of
				some mystery and the punishment of some crime.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;No, no. No crime,&#8221; said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. &#8220;Only one of
				those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have
				four million human beings all jostling each other within the
				space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so
				dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events
				may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be
				presented which may be striking and bizarre without being
				criminal. We have already had experience of such.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;So much so,&#8221; I remarked, &#8220;that of the last six cases which I
				have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any
				legal crime.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler
				papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the
				adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt
				that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category.
				You know Peterson, the commissionaire?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;It is to him that this trophy belongs.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;It is his hat.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will
				look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual
				problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon
				Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I
				have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson&#8217;s
				fire. The facts are these: about four o&#8217;clock on Christmas
				morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was
				returning from some small jollification and was making his way
				homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in
				the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and
				carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the
				corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger
				and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the
				man&#8217;s hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and,
				swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him.
				Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his
				assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and
				seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him,
				dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the
				labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham
				Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of
				Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of
				battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this
				battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Which surely he restored to their owner?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that &#8216;For
				Mrs. Henry Baker&#8217; was printed upon a small card which was tied to
				the bird&#8217;s left leg, and it is also true that the initials &#8216;H.
				B.&#8217; are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are
				some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in
				this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any
				one of them.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;What, then, did Peterson do?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,
				knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me.
				The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs
				that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it
				should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried
				it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose,
				while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who
				lost his Christmas dinner.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Did he not advertise?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Only as much as we can deduce.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;From his hat?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Precisely.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered
				felt?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather
				yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this
				article?&#8221;</p>
				<p>I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather
				ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round
				shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of
				red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker&#8217;s
				name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials &#8220;H. B.&#8221; were
				scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a
				hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was
				cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places,
				although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the
				discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.</p>
				<p>&#8220;I can see nothing,&#8221; said I, handing it back to my friend.</p>
				<p>&#8220;On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail,
				however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in
				drawing your inferences.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?&#8221;</p>
				<p>He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective
				fashion which was characteristic of him. &#8220;It is perhaps less
				suggestive than it might have been,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;and yet there
				are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others
				which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That
				the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the
				face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the
				last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He
				had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a
				moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his
				fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink,
				at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that
				his wife has ceased to love him.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;My dear Holmes!&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,&#8221; he
				continued, disregarding my remonstrance. &#8220;He is a man who leads a
				sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is
				middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the
				last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are
				the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also,
				by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid
				on in his house.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;You are certainly joking, Holmes.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you
				these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I
				am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that
				this man was intellectual?&#8221;</p>
				<p>For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right
				over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. &#8220;It is
				a question of cubic capacity,&#8221; said he; &#8220;a man with so large a
				brain must have something in it.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;The decline of his fortunes, then?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge
				came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the
				band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could
				afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no
				hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the
				foresight and the moral retrogression?&#8221;</p>
				<p>Sherlock Holmes laughed. &#8220;Here is the foresight,&#8221; said he putting
				his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer.
				&#8220;They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a
				sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his
				way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see
				that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace
				it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly,
				which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other
				hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the
				felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not
				entirely lost his self-respect.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Your reasoning is certainly plausible.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is
				grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses
				lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the
				lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of
				hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all
				appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of
				lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey
				dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,
				showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while
				the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the
				wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in
				the best of training.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;But his wife&#8212;you said that she had ceased to love him.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear
				Watson, with a week&#8217;s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and
				when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear
				that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife&#8217;s
				affection.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;But he might be a bachelor.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his
				wife. Remember the card upon the bird&#8217;s leg.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce
				that the gas is not laid on in his house?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I
				see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt
				that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with
				burning tallow&#8212;walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in
				one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never
				got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, it is very ingenious,&#8221; said I, laughing; &#8220;but since, as
				you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm
				done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a
				waste of energy.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew
				open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment
				with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with
				astonishment.</p>
				<p>&#8220;The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!&#8221; he gasped.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off
				through the kitchen window?&#8221; Holmes twisted himself round upon
				the sofa to get a fairer view of the man&#8217;s excited face.</p>
				<p>&#8220;See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!&#8221; He held out
				his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly
				scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but
				of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric
				point in the dark hollow of his hand.</p>
				<p>Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. &#8220;By Jove, Peterson!&#8221; said
				he, &#8220;this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you
				have got?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though
				it were putty.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more than a precious stone. It is <em>the</em> precious stone.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Not the Countess of Morcar&#8217;s blue carbuncle!&#8221; I ejaculated.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I
				have read the advertisement about it in <em>The Times</em> every day
				lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be
				conjectured, but the reward offered of <em>£</em>1000 is certainly
				not within a twentieth part of the market price.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!&#8221; The commissionaire
				plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.</p>
				<p>&#8220;That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are
				sentimental considerations in the background which would induce
				the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but
				recover the gem.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan,&#8221; I
				remarked.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner,
				a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady&#8217;s
				jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case
				has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the
				matter here, I believe.&#8221; He rummaged amid his newspapers,
				glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out,
				doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:</p>
				<p>&#8220;Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was
				brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst.,
				abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the
				valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder,
				upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect
				that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess
				of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might
				solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had
				remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been
				called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared,
				that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco
				casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was
				accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the
				dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was
				arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found
				either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to
				the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder&#8217;s cry of dismay on
				discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,
				where she found matters as described by the last witness.
				Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest
				of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence
				in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for
				robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate
				refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to
				the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion
				during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was
				carried out of court.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Hum! So much for the police-court,&#8221; said Holmes thoughtfully,
				tossing aside the paper. &#8220;The question for us now to solve is the
				sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to
				the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You
				see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much
				more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the
				stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry
				Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other
				characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set
				ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and
				ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To
				do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie
				undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If
				this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;What will you say?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: &#8216;Found at
				the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr.
				Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at
				221B, Baker Street.&#8217; That is clear and concise.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Very. But will he see it?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor
				man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his
				mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson
				that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must
				have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his
				bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to
				see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to
				it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency
				and have this put in the evening papers.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;In which, sir?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, in the <em>Globe</em>, <em>Star</em>, <em>Pall Mall</em>, <em>St. James&#8217;s</em>, <em>Evening News</em>,
				<em>Standard</em>, <em>Echo</em>, and any others that occur to you.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Very well, sir. And this stone?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say,
				Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here
				with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place
				of the one which your family is now devouring.&#8221;</p>
				<p>When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and
				held it against the light. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bonny thing,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Just
				see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and
				focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil&#8217;s pet
				baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a
				bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found
				in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable
				in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is
				blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has
				already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a
				vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about
				for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.
				Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the
				gallows and the prison? I&#8217;ll lock it up in my strong box now and
				drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I cannot tell.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had
				anything to do with the matter?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an
				absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he
				was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made
				of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple
				test if we have an answer to our advertisement.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;And you can do nothing until then?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall
				come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I
				should like to see the solution of so tangled a business.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I
				believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I
				ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop.&#8221;</p>
				<p>I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past
				six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I
				approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a
				coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the
				bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I
				arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to
				Holmes&#8217; room.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,&#8221; said he, rising from his armchair
				and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he
				could so readily assume. &#8220;Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr.
				Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is
				more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have
				just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.&#8221;</p>
				<p>He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a
				broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of
				grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight
				tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes&#8217; surmise as to his
				habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in
				front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded
				from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a
				slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the
				impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had
				ill-usage at the hands of fortune.</p>
				<p>&#8220;We have retained these things for some days,&#8221; said Holmes,
				&#8220;because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your
				address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. &#8220;Shillings have not
				been so plentiful with me as they once were,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;I had
				no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off
				both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a
				hopeless attempt at recovering them.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to
				eat it.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;To eat it!&#8221; Our visitor half rose from his chair in his
				excitement.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so.
				But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is
				about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your
				purpose equally well?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly, certainly,&#8221; answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of
				relief.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of
				your own bird, so if you wish&#8212;&#8221;</p>
				<p>The man burst into a hearty laugh. &#8220;They might be useful to me as
				relics of my adventure,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but beyond that I can hardly
				see what use the <em>disjecta membra</em> of my late acquaintance are
				going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I
				will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive
				upon the sideboard.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug
				of his shoulders.</p>
				<p>&#8220;There is your hat, then, and there your bird,&#8221; said he. &#8220;By the
				way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one
				from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a
				better grown goose.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Certainly, sir,&#8221; said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly
				gained property under his arm. &#8220;There are a few of us who
				frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum&#8212;we are to be found in
				the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our
				good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which,
				on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to
				receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the
				rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a
				Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.&#8221; With
				a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and
				strode off upon his way.</p>
				<p>&#8220;So much for Mr. Henry Baker,&#8221; said Holmes when he had closed the
				door behind him. &#8220;It is quite certain that he knows nothing
				whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Not particularly.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow
				up this clue while it is still hot.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;By all means.&#8221;</p>
				<p>It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped
				cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly
				in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out
				into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out
				crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors&#8217; quarter,
				Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into
				Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at
				the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one
				of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open
				the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from
				the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,&#8221;
				said he.</p>
				<p>&#8220;My geese!&#8221; The man seemed surprised.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker,
				who was a member of your goose club.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them&#8217;s not <em>our</em> geese.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Indeed! Whose, then?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Breckinridge is his name.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Ah! I don&#8217;t know him. Well, here&#8217;s your good health landlord,
				and prosperity to your house. Good-night.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Now for Mr. Breckinridge,&#8221; he continued, buttoning up his coat
				as we came out into the frosty air. &#8220;Remember, Watson that though
				we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we
				have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years&#8217; penal
				servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible
				that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we
				have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police,
				and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us
				follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and
				quick march!&#8221;</p>
				<p>We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a
				zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest
				stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor
				a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was
				helping a boy to put up the shutters.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Good-evening. It&#8217;s a cold night,&#8221; said Holmes.</p>
				<p>The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my
				companion.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Sold out of geese, I see,&#8221; continued Holmes, pointing at the
				bare slabs of marble.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no good.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Ah, but I was recommended to you.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Who by?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;The landlord of the Alpha.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?&#8221;</p>
				<p>To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the
				salesman.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Now, then, mister,&#8221; said he, with his head cocked and his arms
				akimbo, &#8220;what are you driving at? Let&#8217;s have it straight, now.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the
				geese which you supplied to the Alpha.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well then, I shan&#8217;t tell you. So now!&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don&#8217;t know why you
				should be so warm over such a trifle.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Warm! You&#8217;d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.
				When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end
				of the business; but it&#8217;s &#8216;Where are the geese?&#8217; and &#8216;Who did you
				sell the geese to?&#8217; and &#8216;What will you take for the geese?&#8217; One
				would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the
				fuss that is made over them.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been
				making inquiries,&#8221; said Holmes carelessly. &#8220;If you won&#8217;t tell us
				the bet is off, that is all. But I&#8217;m always ready to back my
				opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the
				bird I ate is country bred.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, then, you&#8217;ve lost your fiver, for it&#8217;s town bred,&#8221; snapped
				the salesman.</p>
				<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing of the kind.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I say it is.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled
				them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that
				went to the Alpha were town bred.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never persuade me to believe that.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Will you bet, then?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But
				I&#8217;ll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be
				obstinate.&#8221;</p>
				<p>The salesman chuckled grimly. &#8220;Bring me the books, Bill,&#8221; said
				he.</p>
				<p>The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great
				greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging
				lamp.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Now then, Mr. Cocksure,&#8221; said the salesman, &#8220;I thought that I
				was out of geese, but before I finish you&#8217;ll find that there is
				still one left in my shop. You see this little book?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D&#8217;you see? Well,
				then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers
				after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger.
				Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a
				list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just
				read it out to me.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road&#8212;249,&#8221; read Holmes.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Holmes turned to the page indicated. &#8220;Here you are, &#8216;Mrs.
				Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Now, then, what&#8217;s the last entry?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7<em>s</em>. 6<em>d</em>.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Quite so. There you are. And underneath?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12<em>s</em>.&#8217;&nbsp;&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;What have you to say now?&#8221;</p>
				<p>Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from
				his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the
				air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off
				he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless
				fashion which was peculiar to him.</p>
				<p>&#8220;When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the &#8216;Pink &#8217;un&#8217;
				protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,&#8221;
				said he. &#8220;I daresay that if I had put <em>£</em>100 down in front of
				him, that man would not have given me such complete information
				as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a
				wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our
				quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is
				whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or
				whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what
				that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves
				who are anxious about the matter, and I should&#8212;&#8221;</p>
				<p>His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke
				out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a
				little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of
				yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while
				Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was
				shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.</p>
				<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough of you and your geese,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I wish you
				were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more
				with your silly talk I&#8217;ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs.
				Oakshott here and I&#8217;ll answer her, but what have you to do with
				it? Did I buy the geese off you?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;No; but one of them was mine all the same,&#8221; whined the little
				man.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;She told me to ask you.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I&#8217;ve had
				enough of it. Get out of this!&#8221; He rushed fiercely forward, and
				the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,&#8221; whispered Holmes.
				&#8220;Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this
				fellow.&#8221; Striding through the scattered knots of people who
				lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook
				the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang
				round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of
				colour had been driven from his face.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Who are you, then? What do you want?&#8221; he asked in a quavering
				voice.</p>
				<p>&#8220;You will excuse me,&#8221; said Holmes blandly, &#8220;but I could not help
				overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.
				I think that I could be of assistance to you.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other
				people don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;But you can know nothing of this?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to
				trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton
				Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr.
				Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr.
				Henry Baker is a member.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,&#8221; cried
				the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers.
				&#8220;I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. &#8220;In that
				case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this
				wind-swept market-place,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But pray tell me, before we
				go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting.&#8221;</p>
				<p>The man hesitated for an instant. &#8220;My name is John Robinson,&#8221; he
				answered with a sidelong glance.</p>
				<p>&#8220;No, no; the real name,&#8221; said Holmes sweetly. &#8220;It is always
				awkward doing business with an alias.&#8221;</p>
				<p>A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. &#8220;Well then,&#8221;
				said he, &#8220;my real name is James Ryder.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray
				step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you
				everything which you would wish to know.&#8221;</p>
				<p>The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with
				half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure
				whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe.
				Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in
				the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during
				our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and
				the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous
				tension within him.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Here we are!&#8221; said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.
				&#8220;The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold,
				Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my
				slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then!
				You want to know what became of those geese?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in
				which you were interested&#8212;white, with a black bar across the
				tail.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Ryder quivered with emotion. &#8220;Oh, sir,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;can you tell
				me where it went to?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;It came here.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Here?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don&#8217;t wonder that
				you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was
				dead&#8212;the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen.
				I have it here in my museum.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece
				with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up
				the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold,
				brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a
				drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.</p>
				<p>&#8220;The game&#8217;s up, Ryder,&#8221; said Holmes quietly. &#8220;Hold up, man, or
				you&#8217;ll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair,
				Watson. He&#8217;s not got blood enough to go in for felony with
				impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little
				more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!&#8221;</p>
				<p>For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy
				brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring
				with frightened eyes at his accuser.</p>
				<p>&#8220;I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I
				could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me.
				Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case
				complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the
				Countess of Morcar&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,&#8221; said he in a
				crackling voice.</p>
				<p>&#8220;I see&#8212;her ladyship&#8217;s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of
				sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has
				been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous
				in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the
				making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man
				Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter
				before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.
				What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady&#8217;s
				room&#8212;you and your confederate Cusack&#8212;and you managed that he
				should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled
				the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man
				arrested. You then&#8212;&#8221;</p>
				<p>Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my
				companion&#8217;s knees. &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, have mercy!&#8221; he shrieked.
				&#8220;Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I
				never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I&#8217;ll
				swear it on a Bible. Oh, don&#8217;t bring it into court! For Christ&#8217;s
				sake, don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Get back into your chair!&#8221; said Holmes sternly. &#8220;It is very well
				to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this
				poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the
				charge against him will break down.&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account
				of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came
				the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies
				your only hope of safety.&#8221;</p>
				<p>Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. &#8220;I will tell you
				it just as it happened, sir,&#8221; said he. &#8220;When Horner had been
				arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get
				away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment
				the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my
				room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe.
				I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister&#8217;s
				house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton
				Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there
				every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective;
				and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down
				my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me
				what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I
				had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went
				into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would
				be best to do.</p>
				<p>&#8220;I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and
				has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met
				me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they
				could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to
				me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind
				to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my
				confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money.
				But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had
				gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be
				seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat
				pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at
				the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly
				an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the
				best detective that ever lived.</p>
				<p>&#8220;My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the
				pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she
				was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in
				it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in
				the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds&#8212;a fine big
				one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill
				open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger
				could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass
				along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped
				and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the
				matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and
				fluttered off among the others.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?&#8217; says she.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Well,&#8217; said I, &#8216;you said you&#8217;d give me one for Christmas, and I
				was feeling which was the fattest.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Oh,&#8217; says she, &#8216;we&#8217;ve set yours aside for you&#8212;Jem&#8217;s bird, we
				call it. It&#8217;s the big white one over yonder. There&#8217;s twenty-six
				of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen
				for the market.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Thank you, Maggie,&#8217; says I; &#8216;but if it is all the same to you,
				I&#8217;d rather have that one I was handling just now.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;The other is a good three pound heavier,&#8217; said she, &#8216;and we
				fattened it expressly for you.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Never mind. I&#8217;ll have the other, and I&#8217;ll take it now,&#8217; said I.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Oh, just as you like,&#8217; said she, a little huffed. &#8216;Which is it
				you want, then?&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the
				flock.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird
				all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was
				a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed
				until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My
				heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I
				knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird,
				rushed back to my sister&#8217;s, and hurried into the back yard. There
				was not a bird to be seen there.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Where are they all, Maggie?&#8217; I cried.</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Gone to the dealer&#8217;s, Jem.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Which dealer&#8217;s?&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;But was there another with a barred tail?&#8217; I asked, &#8216;the same
				as the one I chose?&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;&nbsp;&#8216;Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never
				tell them apart.&#8217;</p>
				<p>&#8220;Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my
				feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the
				lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they
				had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always
				answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad.
				Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now&#8212;and now I am myself
				a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which
				I sold my character. God help me! God help me!&#8221; He burst into
				convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.</p>
				<p>There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and
				by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes&#8217; finger-tips upon the
				edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.</p>
				<p>&#8220;Get out!&#8221; said he.</p>
				<p>&#8220;What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!&#8221;</p>
				<p>&#8220;No more words. Get out!&#8221;</p>
				<p>And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon
				the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running
				footfalls from the street.</p>
				<p>&#8220;After all, Watson,&#8221; said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his
				clay pipe, &#8220;I am not retained by the police to supply their
				deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing;
				but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must
				collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just
				possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong
				again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and
				you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of
				forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and
				whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you
				will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin
				another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief
				feature.&#8221;</p>
